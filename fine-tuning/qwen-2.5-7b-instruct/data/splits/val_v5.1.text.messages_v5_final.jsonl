If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON. The rest is plain text.\n- ≥80% of final-answer sentences include [dX] (unless abstaining).\n- Use an EM DASH \" — \" in the label line (not hyphen or en dash).\n- Be precise and faithful; no new facts; respect length budgets.\n\nInputs:\n\n- query:\n{query}\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n{retrieved_docs}\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n{per_doc_notes}\n\nTask:\n1) Follow the full OUTPUT CONTRACT exactly.\n   • <think> block with:\n       (A) VALID JSON array for EVERY doc d1…dN (order-preserving, one object per doc; if verdict==\"irrelevant\" set key_fact=\"\")\n       (B) Conflict reasoning FIRST: cluster docs, reference doc IDs, and NAME the mechanism (temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive)\n       (C) ONE label line: \"<ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\"\n       (D) Brief reasoning connecting evidence to the final answer (or abstention)\n   • ONE blank line\n   • Final answer (or exactly \"CANNOT ANSWER, INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\" if abstaining)\n   • Final sentinel line [[END-OF-ANSWER]].\n\nReminders (DO NOT PRINT):\n- Reason FIRST for the conflict: write the analysis in (B), THEN emit the label line in (C); the label must be a direct consequence of the reasoning.\n- Conflict taxonomy (strict): No conflict / Complementary information / Conflicting opinions or research outcomes / Conflict due to outdated information / Conflict due to misinformation.\n- Use only existing doc_ids in bracketed citations [dX]; no ranges like d1–d5; never cite out-of-bounds [dK].\n- Prefer high-credibility sources and order citations high→low in the evidence list.\n- If any doc is \"supports\" or \"partially supports\", DO NOT abstain.\n- Close </think> before the answer; no extra text outside the required format."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Inputs:\n\n- query:\nWhich video on youtube has the most dislikes?\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLirAqAtl_h2o1ism1dr5SbvB8Mf7Ve6Aa\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Most Disliked YouTube Videos Most Disliked YouTube Videos.

If the five-star rating is now a like, a one-star rating is a dislike. YouTube Worst Video of All Time vote one-star, write a comment was the most disliked video. Shortly after that, Justin Bieber’s Baby exceeded this video. By June 2011, Baby by Justin Bieber had over 1.4 million dislikes, which made us conclude that the dislike button is more popular and used than the like button. Before being removed in 2011, Friday by Rebecca Black got 3.2 million dislikes. Most disliked Youtube videos in 2022 People watch more than a billion hours of video content on YouTube daily.

YouTube Rewind 2018: Everyone Controls Rewind Uploader: YouTube Upload date: December 6, 2018 The YouTube Rewind 2018 was the ninth edition of the series, featuring a recap of the year's highlights. Packed with a star-studded lineup featuring the likes of Ninja, Marques Brownlee, Will Smith, and Trevor Noah, it seemed like it had the ingredients for success. However, it turned out to be a recipe for disaster. It included outdated trends and left out big names like Shane Dawson, MrBeast, and PewDiePie. The result? Just a week after it dropped, Everyone Controls Rewind racked up over 10 million dislikes, claiming the crown for the most disliked video on YouTube.

That's right. J.Biebs made the most disliked YouTube videos list. With 18 million likes and another ... We see what appears to be two young brothers taking a bath together and helping each other get clean. It’s a cute animation until the lines get stuck in your head. We suspect parents hearing this song one too many times in a day may have played a hand in the 8.39 million dislikes. Can you blame them? We’ve seen plenty of children’s videos so far but this may be the longest. Running for a total of five minutes and 10 seconds, this animated video teaches young children about colors via cartoon eggs with somewhat creepy smiles. The video is narrated in Russian, but the song that plays in the background is “Old MacDonald Had a Farm” sung in English. You’ll definitely learn these colors by the end but your dreams may also be filled with smiling Russian eggs – tough tradeoff. 6. \\\"YouTube Rewind 2019: For the Record\\\" by YouTube (9.55m dislikes) Yes, you read that right. A YouTube-generated video is nudging the top 5 for most disliked video. Funnier than that? This video was a response to a 2018 version of the same kind. In this video, users see highlights of the most viewed videos from 2019 - an improvement from its predecessor but still not hitting the mark apparently. This video sits at number 6 with 9.5 million dislikes (more than double the amount of likes). 5. \\\"Johny Johny Yes Papa\\\" by LooLoo Kids (11.44m dislikes) Like so many other songs for kids, this one is repetitive and contains simple lyrics. Running at less than two minutes long, the video itself features a baby trying to sneak sugar cubes when his father isn’t looking. An odd story line that somehow got this video over 11 million dislikes. 4. \\\"Baby\\\" by Justin Bieber (12.40m dislikes) That’s right. J.Biebs made the most disliked YouTube videos list.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2021-10-25\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d6\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://youtube.fandom.com/wiki/Most_disliked_YouTube_videos\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Most disliked YouTube videos - Wikitubia - Fandom The original upload of Rebecca Black's \\\"Friday\\\" yielded 3.2M dislikes before its deletion in June 2011, making it the most disliked at its time, while ... Most disliked YouTube videos Dislikes were introduced on YouTube in March 2010 with the change from the 5-star rating system to likes & dislikes. A 5 star rating would be transformed to a \\\"like\\\", whereas a 1 star rating would become a \\\"dislike\\\". Due to this, the most disliked video was “~YouTube Worst Video of All Time~ vote 1 star, leave comment“. Justin Bieber's \\\"Baby\\\" would soon surpass this. This dislike button would be more used than the like button judging by Baby having over 1.4M dislikes by June 2011. The original upload of Rebecca Black's \\\"Friday\\\" yielded 3.2M dislikes before its deletion in June 2011, making it the most disliked at its time, while simultaneously being the most liked video at 760K likes. “Baby” however did not hit 3.2M dislikes until almost a year later, then eventually becoming the most disliked video on YouTube. The 2nd spot for most disliked was the reupload of the Friday music video. \\\"Baby\\\" remained the most disliked until December 13, 2018 when YouTube Rewind 2018 would surpass it to become the most disliked video of all time. YouTube Rewind 2018 has amassed over 20 million dislikes as of January 2022.

Baby by Justin Bieber ft Ludacris Justin Bieber’s record-breaking hit ‘Baby’ is the next most disliked video on YouTube, which doesn’t come as much of a surprise to those who were around in 2010. This song broke all kinds of records and sent fans of the young singer into a frenzy. It gained a lot of media attention, and with this attention also came the dislikes. Some people loved it, some people hated it, one thing is for sure, the young singer’s life was never the same. ‘Baby’ by Justin Bieber featuring Ludacris made the young Canadian pop star a household name, for better or for worse. This song lands in the number 3 spot on this list with over 15 million dislikes! 4. Johny Johny Yes Papa by LooLoo Kids The next most disliked video on YouTube is ‘Johny Johny Yes Papa by LooLoo Kids’ which is another children’s song. There seems to be a running theme throughout this list. I guess a lot of parents seem to hate these songs after hearing them for the hundredth time. This catchy kids video that has the same rhythm as ‘Twinkle Twinkle Little Star’ has the comments turned off, so it’s not clear as to why this video has over 13 million dislikes. 5. Bath Song by CoComelon This seemingly innocent children’s song has gotten a lot of backlash and dislikes, making it number 5 on our list. It seems to be a mash-up of one classic children’s song and another popular one. Nearly everyone knows the tune to “Old McDonald Had a Farm” and the now ever-popular “Baby Shark”. The video is a quite pleasant animation where an older brother helps his younger brother bathe, and they sing about it joyfully in the tub.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only.

With six Women’s Rugby World Cup titles to their name, the Black Ferns will be looking to demonstrate their attacking flair, expansive play and impressive skillset on the global stage once again. New Zealand became the first host nation to win a women’s Rugby World Cup as they beat England 34-31 at a sold-out Eden Park during the Rugby World Cup 2021 (played in 2022). Bolstered by a number of Olympic Sevens players, the side were able to utilise their attacking prowess throughout the competition. Ruby Tui, Sarah Hirini, Portia Woodman-Wickliffe, Theresa Fitzpatrick and Stacey Fluhler each played a huge part in the Black Ferns’ success and their return to 15s was aided by a familiar face in their former sevens coach Allan Bunting. Woodman-Wickliffe, on her way to becoming the top try-scorer in Rugby World Cup history, scored a hat-trick in their opening RWC 2021 match against Australia to help the Black Ferns recover from going 17-0 behind to win 41-17. Tui also touched down twice at a packed Eden Park and crossed the whitewash in each of her subsequent appearances before the final, including a pivotal score in the nail-biting semi-final defeat of France. Last year’s inaugural WXV 1 competition saw the Black Ferns compete on home territory, however, the side struggled to maintain their previous form and suffered a 17-18 defeat to France in the opening round. A relentless performance from the Black Ferns the following week saw the side return to winning ways, recording a 70-7 victory against Wales.

New Zealand are world champions after a thrilling 34-31 win against an England side that had Lydia Thompson sent off after only 17 minutes. This was the biggest game of women’s rugby ever played and, somehow, it exceeded even that lofty billing. New Zealand are the Rugby World Cup champions but only after a quite stunning contest that demonstrated why the tournament has captured the imaginations of so many. England will feel bereft but they played a full part in perhaps the best World Cup final in history. It was also the Red Roses’ worst nightmare. This was a second chastening defeat to the Black Ferns in consecutive World Cup finals and their first defeat to anyone in 31 Tests. They were 14-0 up and cruising in the first quarter, only to be reduced to 14 players after a red card was shown to the winger Lydia Thompson for a high challenge on the outstanding Portia Woodman. In that misjudged split second, everything changed. Even deep into the final moments, however, one final shot at redemption remained. England, having been awarded a penalty, opted for one last lineout five metres out. For weeks their driving maul has been all but unstoppable and the stage was set. When it mattered most, though, the ball ended up in grateful Kiwi hands and the defending champions were safe. Given England have had the benefit of full-time contracts for longer than any of their rivals, it must also rank as one of the great coaching heists. When Wayne Smith took over earlier this year, the Black Ferns were in disarray after a coruscating review into the treatment of the players by the previous regime. Smith simply told his players to go out and play with freedom and joy. The rest is history. A world-record crowd of 42,579 for a women’s fixture added further resonance to an occasion which had everything. Neither side really deserved to lose but New Zealand’s sixth try of the night with eight minutes left, scored by the replacement wing Ayesha Leti-I’iga after a world-class offload from the centre Stacey Fluhler, was something special.

In 2022, after a year of postponement, Aotearoa New Zealand hosted the Women’s Rugby World Cup. The sporting spectacle took place over one month, between 8 October and 12 November, with three venues being used. The World Cup was a great success with over 150,000 fans attending the 26 matches.

More importantly, the sporting event captured the attention of the nation as symbolized by the record-setting crowd of 42,579 fans in attendance for the final. In a sport so dominated by physicality and brawn, it is no surprise that the emphasis has traditionally been placed on men’s participation.

At a time when rugby participation numbers are declining – Statista shows 133,600 players participating in England in 2021 compared to 259,600 in 2016 – there is proof to show that opening the game up to women is the true opportunity to grow the game. Equal opportunity in rugby has long been an issue. The men’s game professionalized in the 1990s, but it was not until 2018 that some of the Black Ferns received semi-professional contracts. In the run-up to their hosting of the World Cup, the Black Ferns were heavily criticized for poor performances, losing an unprecedented four times in a row, and receiving their heaviest ever losses at the hands of tournament favorites England.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

After experimenting with metrics based on processor count in 1992, the idea arose at the University of Mannheim to use a detailed listing of installed systems as the basis. In early 1993, Jack Dongarra was persuaded to join the project with his LINPACK benchmarks. A first test version was produced in May 1993, partly based on data available on the Internet, including the following sources:[4][5] \\\"List of the World's Most Powerful Computing Sites\\\" maintained by Gunter Ahrendt[6] David Kahaner, the director of the Asian Technology Information Program (ATIP);[7] published a report in 1992, titled \\\"Kahaner Report on Supercomputer in Japan\\\"[5] which had an immense amount of data.[citation needed] The information from those sources was used for the first two lists. Since June 1993, the TOP500 is produced bi-annually based on site and vendor submissions only. Since 1993, performance of the No. 1 ranked position has grown steadily in accordance with Moore's law, doubling roughly every 14 months. In June 2018, Summit was fastest with an Rpeak[8] of 187.6593 PFLOPS. For comparison, this is over 1,432,513 times faster than the Connection Machine CM-5/1024 (1,024 cores), which was the fastest system in November 1993 (twenty-five years prior) with an Rpeak of 131.0 GFLOPS.[9] Two computers which first appeared on the list in 2018 were based on architectures new to the TOP500.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-12-19\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/top-7-most-powerful-supercomputers-in-the-world-right-now\",\n    \"snippet\": \"The 7 most powerful supercomputers in the world right now The 7 most powerful supercomputers in the world right now · 1.

Supercomputers work based on the same principles as everyday computers, but their performance levels are much higher and they look more like the classic mainframes of old. Unlike normal desktop PCs or laptops, they process massive data sets and perform calculations at incredible speeds. They're the fastest computers in the world, according to IBM, and require a massive amount of infrastructure to operate — including advanced cooling systems. Architecturally, they are also fitted with many more components than normal PCs. Your laptop might have one central processing unit (CPU) and one graphics processing unit (GPU), but one supercomputer may have thousands upon thousands of CPUs and GPUs — each of them considerably more powerful than those you find off the shelf. Their performance is also measured using floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) — where one floating-point operation is a mathematical calculation. The most powerful supercomputer in the world now exceeds 1 exaFLOP — 1 quintillion (1018) FLOPS — while normal PCs and laptops usually have power of several hundred gigaFLOPS — 1 trillion (109) FLOPS. We refer to machines like this as exascale supercomputers. Because they can work with massive amounts of data and process calculations incredibly fast, scientists often use supercomputers to crack problems in drug and material discovery. Supercomputers can also make predictions — like forecasting the weather — and even learn how to play chess, like IBM's classic Deep Blue supercomputer in 1997. Based on the latest TOP500 rankings, here are the seven most powerful supercomputers online today. Currently top of the list, Frontier — built by supercomputing giant HPE Cray — became the first exascale computer in the world when it went online in 2022. Scientists initially planned to use Frontier for cancer research, drug discovery, nuclear fusion, exotic materials, designing superefficient engines and modeling stellar explosions, according to IEEE Spectrum. In the coming years, scientists will use Frontier to design new transport and medicine technologies, reported MIT Technology Review.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-28\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.pcmag.com/news/us-el-capitan-is-now-the-worlds-fastest-supercomputer-top500\",\n    \"snippet\": \"US' El Capitan Is Now the World's Fastest Supercomputer | PCMag In a recent verified test, El Capitan achieved 1.742 exaFLOPs of performance or 1.742 quintillion calculations per second, according to Lawrence ...

In a recent verified test, El Capitan achieved 1.742 exaFLOPs of performance or 1.742 quintillion calculations per second, according to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, where the supercomputer is based. Top500, which benchmarks and catalogs the world’s fastest supercomputers, previously ranked Frontier and Aurora as the two top machines. In this latest round, the AMD-powered Frontier was benchmarked at 1.35 exaFLOPs, while its top theoretical speed was rated at 2.05 exaFLOPs.

The system has a total peak performance of 2.79 exaFLOPs. The Top500 list was released at the 2024 Supercomputing Conference (SC24) in Atlanta. As NNSA’s first exascale supercomputer, El Capitan is a premier resource for the NNSA Tri-Labs — LLNL, and Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories — to advance nuclear weapon science and scientific discovery, providing the vast computational power necessary to ensure the safety, security and reliability of the nation’s nuclear deterrent without nuclear testing. This state-of-the-art system marks a monumental leap forward in HPC, enabling unprecedented modeling and simulation capability essential for NNSA’s Stockpile Stewardship Program that certifies the U.S. nuclear stockpile, and other critical nuclear security missions such as nonproliferation and counterterrorism. “El Capitan’s introduction continues the capability advancement needed to sustain our stockpile without returning to explosive nuclear testing. This computational capability, backed by decades of data, expertise and code development is the heart of science-based stockpile stewardship,” said Jill Hruby, Department of Energy (DOE) under secretary for nuclear security and NNSA administrator. “We will continue to invest in the technological and scientific infrastructure necessary to underpin the nuclear security enterprise.” NNSA Tri-Lab scientists will utilize El Capitan’s speed and unparalleled capabilities to further advance NNSA’s core mission of maintaining an aging stockpile while simultaneously pursuing weapon modernization such as the W87-1 and W93 warheads currently under development.

The performance of a supercomputer is commonly measured in floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) instead of million instructions per second (MIPS). Since 2022, supercomputers have existed which can perform over 1018 FLOPS, so called exascale supercomputers.[3] For comparison, a desktop computer has performance in the range of hundreds of gigaFLOPS (1011) to tens of teraFLOPS (1013).[4][5] Since November 2017, all of the world's fastest 500 supercomputers run on Linux-based operating systems.[6] Additional research is being conducted in the United States, the European Union, Taiwan, Japan, and China to build faster, more powerful and technologically superior exascale supercomputers.[7] Supercomputers were introduced in the 1960s, and for several decades the fastest was made by Seymour Cray at Control Data Corporation (CDC), Cray Research and subsequent companies bearing his name or monogram. The first such machines were highly tuned conventional designs that ran more quickly than their more general-purpose contemporaries. Through the decade, increasing amounts of parallelism were added, with one to four processors being typical. In the 1970s, vector processors operating on large arrays of data came to dominate. A notable example is the highly successful Cray-1 of 1976. Vector computers remained the dominant design into the 1990s. From then until today, massively parallel supercomputers with tens of thousands of off-the-shelf processors became the norm.[9][10] The US has long been the leader in the supercomputer field, first through Cray's almost uninterrupted dominance of the field, and later through a variety of technology companies.

El Capitan, built by HPE, tops the 2024 TOP500 list as the world’s fastest supercomputer, driving breakthroughs in AI, nuclear research, and energy. El Capitan, the record-breaking supercomputer built by HPE and housed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, has officially claimed the title of the world’s fastest supercomputer, according to the latest TOP500 rankings. “El Capitan marks another significant milestone in exascale supercomputing, bringing monumental performance, energy efficiency, and the capabilities to accelerate AI-driven scientific discovery and make incredible breakthroughs to strengthen national security and unlock new opportunities in renewable energy,” Trish Damkroger, senior vice president and general manager, HPC & AI Infrastructure Solutions, said in a press release. The TOP500 team clocked El Capitan at a Linpack score of 1.742 EFlop/s, a standardized measure of how quickly the system can solve a complex sequence of linear equations. El Capitan supports the work of the U.S. National Nuclear Security Administration, including research on nuclear weapons and deterrents. The lab also uses the machine for scientific research on energy security, climate change, power grid modernization, and drug discovery. The supercomputer uses AMD 4th-generation EPYC processors, the Cray Slingshot 11 network for data transfer, and a custom storage solution. The world’s number one supercomputer has 11,039,616 combined CPU and GPU cores. It runs at 58.89 gigaflops performance per watt. Top 5 Supercomputers of 2024 The Frontier system at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee Frontier increased its exaflops to 1.353 Eflop/s on the November list, but that was still insufficient to prevent El Capitan from knocking Frontier down from the top spot.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Malcolm also occasionally serves as the voice of reason, and does have a conscience. For instance, despite emotionally manipulating a grieving Hal to buy him a car in the episode \\\"Hal Grieves,\\\" when the time comes to make the purchase, he feels guilty (but just as Hal begins to sign, Lois finally turns up and she, not Malcom, puts an end to it). In the series finale, it is revealed that Lois intended him to have a hard life, knowing that he is destined to assume the role of President of the United States. Lois wants him to remember where he came from to get there and help families like his own when he assumes the office. Malcolm eventually comes to terms with his future, after being unable to tell her that he can not do it. In the series finale, he begins taking classes at Harvard University. Throughout the series, Malcolm frequently breaks the fourth wall and talks to the viewer about either the current situation or provides exposition about past events.[2] Lois Lois, played by Jane Kaczmarek (146 episodes), is Francis, Reese, Malcolm, Dewey, and Jamie's temperamental and overbearing mother. She is despised by the neighbors to the point that they refuse to invite her to their gatherings, revealed in \\\"Mono\\\". Unlike Malcolm, Lois is not bothered by it and tries her best to blend in with it. Lois is 38 years old as of Season 2, and had originally planned to attend music school and become a concert violinist before she married Hal (\\\"Lois' Birthday\\\"). She was revealed to be a charming and nurturing mother while Francis was little, but toughened up. When she became more overbearing and demanding, it did not help Francis or the other boys to behave, but she unknowingly made it worse. She also stubbornly believes she is always in the right, to the point of being unable to say that she was wrong. Lois's severe anger issues are very often caused by her sons' frequent bad behavior, and also from her miserable childhood.

A gifted young teen tries to survive life with his dimwitted, dysfunctional family. A gifted young teen tries to survive life with his dimwitted, dysfunctional family. Malcolm in the Middle is an incredible show. My feeling toward the show was rather mixed when they began showing promos. It looked funny, but silly and unoriginal. After all, the concept of a family that doesn't get along is nothing new. The show turned out to be better than I expected. It's not a live action version of The Simpsons like some critics claim, but it is very funny. Don't be quick to judge the show or you might find the jokes go over your head. Thumbs up on this one. Storyline Did you know Bryan Cranston did several of his own stunts. Besides the cartwheel and the headstand, he did his own roller disco skating, spending all the free time he had in the 1-1/2 weeks he had to learn how to skate. After one of the show's writers asked jokingly whether Cranston would be willing to wear a suit of live bees, he said he would, so they wrote a script around the idea (The Bots and the Bees (2000)). He ended up covered in 10,000 bees, and only got stung once. Throughout his appearances in seasons 1-3, Commandant Edwin Spangler wears decorations that absolutely make no sense. While his uniform is clearly that of an USAF general, he nonetheless wears both the Pistol Expert and Rifle Expert badges of the USMC, while also sporting the ribbons for several decorations available solely to personnel of the US Army - the Army Distinguished Service Medal, the Soldier's Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, the Army Overseas Service Ribbon, and the Army Service Ribbon (the latter two worn in the wrong order of precedence).\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2000-03-19\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_in_the_Middle\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Malcolm in the Middle - Wikipedia The ensemble cast includes Jane Kaczmarek and Bryan Cranston as Malcolm's parents, Lois and Hal.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only.

After ... Anglo-Zanzibar War, (August 27, 1896), brief conflict between the British Empire and the East African island sultanate of Zanzibar. Following the death of the previous sultan, Zanzibari Prince Khālid ibn Barghash refused to accept the British Empire’s preferred successor and instead occupied the sultan’s palace, which prompted imperial cruisers to fire on his position. The war lasted no longer than 40 minutes, making it the shortest war in recorded history. Context In the late 19th century, Britain’s extended its influence over East Africa in general and Zanzibar in particular. While SayyidSaʿīd ibn Sulṭān had expanded Zanzibar’s regional holdings and global mercantile importance in the first half the century, his successor Barghash was forced to bend to European powers and partition his land among the British and the Germans; later sultans followed suit. By 1890 Britain had convinced the sultanate to cede its mainland territories to Germany while allowing the island itself to become a protectorate of the British Empire. Britain agreed to preserve the sultanate as an institution, but it stressed that the power of the sultan was nominal. What was the shortest war in history? An episode of Breaking Bad has a longer run time than the Anglo-Zanzibar War. Upon becoming Zanzibar’s protector, Britain outlined two key policy goals: the abolition of slavery and the restoration of the island’s strong mercantile economy. Consul General Gerald Portal’s economic policy angered the Zanzibari merchants, but what angered them more was the policy on slavery, which had become integral to their way of life as spice plantations surged in value throughout the 19th century. Sayyid Ali ibn Saʿīd resisted Britain’s directives until his death in 1893, and, when it came time to choose his successor, Britain voiced its expectation that the next sultan be more submissive to imperial authority. Out of the several claimants to the throne, the British backed Ḥamad ibn Thuwayn.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2019-09-17\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.myjournalcourier.com/news/article/holy-cow-history-18107412.php\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Holy cow! history: Ready, set, surrender!

Transcript An average-length episode, a flight from Paris to London, one half of a soccer game: these are all longer than the shortest war in history. The Anglo-Zanzibar War took place on August 27, 1896. It lasted less than 40 minutes. The East African island of Zanzibar had come under the control of the British Empire just a few years before. Britain had two goals for its new protectorate: abolish slavery there and fix the economy. Britain had agreed to keep the existing sultanate in place, but the sultan’s power was diminished by Zanzibar’s treaty with Britain. British officials soon found some sultans to be more receptive toward their agenda than others. During the 1890s the British government tried to install a ruler who would support abolition: a tough ask in Zanzibar, where the economy was built on the spice trade and ending slavery meant earning the ire of many of the richest members of the population. Ḥamad ibn Thuwayn was made sultan in 1893. Ḥamad was seen as a puppet of the British Empire. He ruled peacefully until his death in 1896. Speculation persists that his sudden death may have been murder on the part of his nephew, Prince Khālid ibn Barghash. After Ḥamad’s untimely demise, Prince Khālid—who had been passed over as sultan twice already—claimed the palace (and its harem). He assembled an army of more than 2,800 men, artillery, and an armed yacht. The British warned Khālid that they would take military action if he did not vacate the palace by 9:00 AM on August 27th. Prince Khālid defied the order. British warships opened fire at 9:00 AM as promised. Within two minutes the majority of Khālid’s artillery was destroyed. The forces of the prince fought on for nearly 40 more minutes: they suffered 500 casualties by the time the onslaught halted.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-08-05\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.historyextra.com/period/victorian/shortest-war-history/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"How Long Was The 1896 Anglo-Zanzibar War? - HistoryExtra Fought on 27 August 1896 between the British empire and the Sultanate of Zanzibar, the whole thing lasted around 38 minutes. The Anglo-Zanzibar War of 1896 will never be considered one of the world’s significant conflicts; it wasn’t even the biggest for the British during that decade, with the Second Boer War coming a few years later. But it does hold a distinct honour: it is the shortest war ever recorded in history. Advertisement Why is the Anglo-Zanzibar War the shortest war in history? Fought on 27 August 1896 between the British empire and the Sultanate of Zanzibar, the whole thing lasted around 38 minutes. It ended with a complete victory for the British, who cemented their position in Zanzibar for decades to come. The war’s brevity, however, belied the complex geopolitics that led to its outbreak in the first place. What was the background to the Anglo-Zanzibar War? Zanzibar, an archipelago off the East African coast of modern-day Tanzania, was a strategic hub in the Indian Ocean, rich in resources and a crossroads for trade routes. By 1890, it had become a British protectorate, meaning that while the sultan remained a figurehead it was the British empire that wielded political and military control. Britain’s interests in Zanzibar were primarily driven by trade concerns, which had to be placed in the wider context of imperialist competition with other European colonial powers in Africa, notably the German empire. The islands had proven to be crucial for controlling shipping lanes from British India to Europe. Moreover, the British had launched a campaign to suppress the East African slave trade, motivated by both humanitarian and imperialist purposes, and Zanzibar had long been a major trafficking centre. What caused the Anglo-Zanzibar War to break out? The catalyst for the war was the death of the pro-British sultan, Hamad bin Thuwaini, in August 1896. While not confirmed, he was almost certainly poisoned by his cousin, Khālid ibn Barghash, who then hastily declared himself the new sultan.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-11-26\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d5\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.history.org.uk/publications/resource/7950/the-shortest-war-in-history-the-anglo-zanzibar-wa\",\n    \"snippet\": \"The shortest war in history: The Anglo-Zanzibar War of 1896 Over 500 defenders died, compared to one British marine who was injured. Thus ended what is widely regarded as the 'shortest war in history.'. The shortest war in history: The Anglo-Zanzibar War of 1896 At 9am on 27 August 1896, following an ultimatum, five ships of the Royal Navy began a bombardment of the Royal Palace and Harem in Zanzibar. Thirty-eight, or 40, or 43 minutes later, depending on which source you believe, the bombardment stopped when the white flag of surrender was raised over what was left of the palace. Over 500 defenders died, compared to one British marine who was injured. Thus ended what is widely regarded as the ‘shortest war in history.' The immediate cause of the war was the death of the Sultan of Zanzibar, Hamad bin Thuwaini on the 25 August. His nephew, Khalid bin Bargash, seized power, but he was regarded by the British as far too independent. They preferred Hamud bin Muhammed. In the best tradition of gunboat diplomacy, an ultimatum was issued at 8am, giving Khalid an hour to surrender and leave the palace. When the ultimatum expired the bombardment began, and a force of marines was landed on the shore. As the shells landed, Khalid bin Bargash fled the palace seeking safety in the German consulate, from which he was quickly and in secret shipped out of the country. Order was restored and Britain's preferred ruler Hamud bin Muhammed was installed as Sultan of Zanzibar where he ruled, with British assistance, until his death in 1902.

When tensions escalate into full-fledged war, series of gruesome battles often ensue that sometimes may last for years on end. Some wars, however, are settled much more quickly, whether due to one side's absolutely dominance over their opposition, or lack of enthusiasm and commitment from military leadership on either side to begin with. Each of the wars listed below lasted no longer than a matter of weeks, with the shortest on the list being discussed in terms of minutes. 10. Falklands War, 1982 (10 weeks) The Falkland Wars took place starting on April 2nd, 1982, when Argentinian forces landed on the Falkland Islands off of the coast of Argentina under the authorization of President Leopoldo Galtieri. At the time, the islands were British territory, and after the Argentinians captured two of the islands, the British responded by dispatching troops into the area. They sent part of their navy for support, as well as an amphibious task force. After ten weeks, on June 14th, the British forces had the Argentinians surrounded on land and barred at sea. During these 10 weeks, the British suffered 258 casualties and 777 wounded, while the Argentinians suffered 649 casualties, 1,068 wounded, and 11,313 captured. 9.

According to the Polish, the war only consisted of the fight for the Suwałki Region, which took place from September to October of 1920 as part of the Polish-Soviet War. The Lithuanians, on the other hand, argue that the war was fought from the Spring of 1919 until November of 1920 as part of their war for independence.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2017-04-25\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d7\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk3TBqgoy1E\",\n    \"snippet\": \"How Britain Won a War in Just 38 Minutes (The Anglo-Zanzibar War ...

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

The Library will reopen to the public on Friday, January 10. Breadcrumb John F. Kennedy and Religion Anti-Catholic prejudice was still very much in the mainstream of American life when JFK decided to seek the presidency in 1960. Only one Catholic, Governor Alfred E. Smith of New York, had ever been the presidential nominee of one of the major parties. Smith’s 1928 campaign was dogged by claims that he would build a tunnel connecting the White House and the Vatican and would amend the Constitution to make Catholicism the nation’s established religion. He was overwhelmingly defeated—even losing much of the then Democratic Solid South. JFK established an informal network of advisers on the religious issue—including speechwriter Ted Sorensen, Dean Francis Bowes Sayre Jr. of the National Cathedral and several journalists. It was clear from the outset that Kennedy had to enter the state primaries to prove to skeptical party leaders that he was a viable national candidate. In the Wisconsin primary, he defeated Senator Hubert Humphrey with 56% of the vote but failed to win a majority of the Protestant vote—an ominous sign. West Virginia Primary As a result , Kennedy decided to enter the West Virginia primary—a state in which Catholics constituted less than 4% of the electorate. When the polls in West Virginia showed JFK behind by 20 points, he decided to address the issue head on in a speech before the American Society of Newspaper Editors: Are we going to admit to the world that a Jew can be elected Mayor of Dublin, a Protestant can be chosen Foreign Minister of France, a Moslem can be elected to the Israeli parliament—but a Catholic cannot be President of the United States? Are we going to admit to the world--worse still, are we going to admit to ourselves—that one-third of the American people is forever barred from the White House?\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/01/20/biden-only-second-catholic-president-but-nearly-all-have-been-christians-2/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Almost all presidents have been Christians; Biden is second Catholic Although Catholicism has long been one of the largest U.S. religious groups, John F. Kennedy and Joe Biden are the only Catholic presidents. Biden is only the second Catholic president, but nearly all have been Christians Although about one-in-five U.S. adults are Catholic and Catholicism has long been one of the nation’s largest religious groups, John F. Kennedy was the only Catholic president until Biden was sworn in on Jan. 20. Aside from Biden, only one other Catholic, John Kerry, has been a presidential nominee on a major party ticket since Kennedy’s assassination in 1963. How we did this This analysis is an update to posts published in 2015 and 2017 about the religious affiliation of U.S. presidents. Data for this post was compiled from news reports and uses information from the Miller Center, the University of Virginia, PBS’s God at the White House and the Harry S. Truman Library and Museum. The U.S. Constitution famously prohibits any religious test or requirement for public office. Still, almost all of the nation’s presidents have been Christians and many have been Episcopalians or Presbyterians, with most of the rest belonging to other prominent Protestant denominations. One-in-five U.S. adults say it is “very important” for the president to have strong religious beliefs, and 14% say it is very important to have a president who shares their own religious beliefs, according to a February 2020 Pew Research Center survey. A far higher share (63%) say it is very important to have a president who personally lives a moral and ethical life. The previous president, Donald Trump, was included as a Presbyterian in a previous version of this analysis, but he said in an October 2020 interview with Religion News Service that he no longer identifies as a Presbyterian: “I now consider myself to be a nondenominational Christian.” Historically, about a quarter of presidents – including some of the nation’s most famous leaders, such as George Washington, James Madison and Franklin Roosevelt – were members of the Episcopal Church, the American successor to the Church of England. Presbyterians are the next largest group, with eight presidents, including Andrew Jackson and Ronald Reagan.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2021-01-20\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_John_F._Kennedy\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Presidency of John F.

Nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days, nor in the life of this Administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. But let us begin.\\\" In closing, he expanded on his desire for greater internationalism: \\\"Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you.[17] The address reflected Kennedy's confidence that his administration would chart a historically significant course in both domestic policy and foreign affairs.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.amazon.com/Making-Catholic-President-Kennedy-Nixon/dp/0195374487\",\n    \"snippet\": \"The Making of a Catholic President: Kennedy vs. Nixon 1960 Kennedy, was one of the closest and most contentious in American history.

Inaugural Address Inaugural Address Excerpt We observe today, not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom – symbolizing an end as well as a beginning – signifying renewal as well as change. For I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our forebears prescribed nearly a century and three-quarters ago. The world is very different now. For man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life. And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe–the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God. We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution. Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans–born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage–and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d6\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.history.com/news/jfk-catholic-president\",\n    \"snippet\": \"How John F.

On September 12, 1960, less than two months before Americans would choose the next president of the United States, Democratic candidate John F. Kennedy was in Texas giving a speech to a Houston gathering of Southern Baptist clergy. This wasn’t a normal campaign stop. Kennedy was Catholic and, at the time, only the second Catholic presidential candidate in U.S. history after Al Smith’s unsuccessful run in 1928. And for a Catholic candidate from New England, a conference of Southern Baptist ministers was considered ground zero for anti-Catholic political rhetoric and even outright bigotry. JFK: Catholic for President “[C]ontrary to common newspaper usage, I am not the Catholic candidate for president,” Kennedy said on live TV in his now famous address. “I am the Democratic Party's candidate for president, who happens also to be a Catholic. I do not speak for my church on public matters, and the church does not speak for me.” In the late 1950s, Catholic politicians were viewed with open suspicion by many mainline Protestants and Evangelicals. Shaun Casey, director of the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs at Georgetown University, and author of The Making of a Catholic President, says that Catholic candidates were accused of having “dual loyalties” to both the Vatican and the United States. “The argument was, when push came to shove, a president who was Roman Catholic would ultimately be more loyal to the Vatican because the fate of his eternal soul was at stake,” says Casey. “If Kennedy was elected president, he’d criminalize birth control, he’d cut off foreign aid that helped countries invest in birth control, and he’d funnel tax money to Catholic parochial schools.” Kennedy Watch the three-episode documentary event, Kennedy.

United States presidential election of 1960, American presidential election held on November 8, 1960, in which Democrat John F. Kennedy narrowly defeated Republican Vice Pres. Richard M. Nixon. Kennedy thus became the first Roman Catholic and the youngest person ever elected president. Kennedy was also the first president born in the 20th century. On the Republican side there was little doubt that their nominee would be Nixon. Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York, who had indicated late in 1959 that he might seek the Republican nomination, withdrew in late December in the face of almost total opposition by Republican Party leaders. Nixon entered some of the primaries, but only to demonstrate his vote-getting abilities. He never faced any serious opposition. Watch Democrats campaigning in the 1960 U.S. presidential primariesScenes from the 1960 Democratic Party primary election campaigns, with U.S. Sen. John F. Kennedy striving to prove himself to the public and to party leaders in the race to become the Democratic nominee in the U.S. presidential election. Throughout the primaries and the fall campaign, Kennedy’s religion was a dominant issue. He would become only the second Roman Catholic ever to be nominated for president by a major party (the first was Democratic Gov. Al Smith of New York, who lost to Herbert Hoover in 1928). Some Protestant ministers and prominent laymen expressed fears that a Catholic president would be under the domination of the pope and would not always be free to act in the best interests of the country, charges which Kennedy denied. Kennedy and Humphrey were the only major Democratic contenders to enter presidential primaries in 1960. Their first significant primary was in Wisconsin in April. Both Humphrey and Kennedy campaigned energetically in that state, which borders Humphrey’s home state of Minnesota. Kennedy won easily and was especially strong in Milwaukee and other areas where there were large numbers of Catholic voters. A month later Kennedy all but eliminated Humphrey from consideration by defeating him in West Virginia, a heavily Protestant state, proving that he could win in a state with few Catholics.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d9\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/1600/presidents/johnfkennedy\",\n    \"snippet\": \"John F.

On November 22, 1963, when he was hardly past his first thousand days in office, John Fitzgerald Kennedy was killed by an assassin's bullets as his motorcade wound through Dallas, Texas. Kennedy was the youngest man elected President; he was the youngest to die. Of Irish descent, he was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, on May 29, 1917. Graduating from Harvard in 1940, he entered the Navy. In 1943, when his PT boat was rammed and sunk by a Japanese destroyer, Kennedy, despite grave injuries, led the survivors through perilous waters to safety. Back from the war, he became a Democratic Congressman from the Boston area, advancing in 1953 to the Senate. He married Jacqueline Bouvier on September 12, 1953. In 1955, while recuperating from a back operation, he wrote Profiles in Courage, which won the Pulitzer Prize in history. In 1956 Kennedy almost gained the Democratic nomination for Vice President, and four years later was a first-ballot nominee for President. Millions watched his television debates with the Republican candidate, Richard M. Nixon. Winning by a narrow margin in the popular vote, Kennedy became the first Roman Catholic President. His Inaugural Address offered the memorable injunction: \\\"Ask not what your country can do for you--ask what you can do for your country.\\\" As President, he set out to redeem his campaign pledge to get America moving again.

Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label.

The Answer May Surprise You – Newair The right temperature for full-bodied reds truly is room temperature — provided you keep your house at 64 to 65 degrees year-round. If that sounds little cool to you, you’re not alone. Many people prefer indoor temperatures between 68 and 75, which would be significantly warmer than the temperature at which you should drink your wine. The result? Even a “room temperature” wine may be at its best a bit colder than you have been led to believe. Expert Advice About When to Chill Red Wine Now that you understand the basics of body and serving temperature, you can dive into the nitty-gritty. Set your wine fridge to the right temperature for serving your reds based on their body, and you’ll get it right every time: Full-Bodied Reds: 64 to 65 degrees Medium-Bodied Reds: 60 to 62 degrees Light-Bodied Reds: 55 to 60 degrees As you can see, many sommeliers recommend that light-bodied red be chilled just a touch before serving. These reds are ideal straight out of the cellar or wine fridge, and as you sip, you’ll notice how they warm in the glass toward the warmer end of the ideal temperature range. For medium- and full-bodied reds, you’ll need to remove them from storage and bring them up a few degrees before serving — if you want them in the 60-degree range. This is most easily accomplished by placing the bottles on your bar or table 30 minutes before serving; however, you can also harness the convenience of a dual-zone wine fridge that lets you adjust the temperatures to serving standard a few hours before your dinner. Best Red Wines for Chilling If you have tried drinking your reds a bit cooler as recommended above, and you like the results, you might consider select varieties of reds that are ideal for serving chilled.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.decanter.com/learn/red-wine-serving-temperature-420885/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"What's the perfect red wine serving temperature? Ask Decanter Can you serve red wine chilled? When recommending lighter summer wines in Decanter magazine’s September 2020 issue, Peter Richards MW wrote that ‘good summer reds should be served at 10°C-16°C (50°F-60°F)’. He added, ‘That’s significantly cooler than many a summer’s day, so don’t be afraid to pop them in the fridge for 30 minutes before serving.’ It can be hard to generalise about particular wines or grape varieties due to variations in winemaking styles. But you’d typically find Beaujolais (Gamay) and Valpolicella Classico (Corvina) towards the lighter, chilled end of the serving temperature spectrum. The below graphic from Decanter’s archive shows how Pinot Noir would generally range from light to medium-bodied, with some styles of Rioja (Tempranillo) in the mid-range and then the Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant and Syrah / Shiraz wines of this world in the full-bodied band. Credit: Annabelle Sing / Decanter Oak, ageing and structure Certain grape varieties just have more tannin, colour and potential to create full, structured wine than others. Yet the age of the wine and also how it has been handled in the cellar can affect things. Is your red wine temperature too warm? Alcohol levels may then feel out-of-balance and the wine’s natural structure and freshness can be lost. Wine is a question of personal taste, but these are generally considered undesirable qualities. Many of us have probably experienced a soupy red wine at one time or another, whether on holiday in a warm climate or in a restaurant that hasn’t got its wine cellar under control. Don’t be afraid to ask for the ice bucket for a few minutes. How can you get the serving temperature right? A wine fridge with temperature control is obviously the gold standard here, but a simple wine thermometer can also help. It might also be helpful to know the temperature of the room you’re in.

Wine Enthusiast Magazine ranked the Austin Hope Cabernet Sauvignon 2018 as the #7 on The Enthusiast Top 100 of 2020, which marks the 2nd time in two years that his wines have made it into the top 10. And on top of that, it’s the only wine from Paso Robles to break the top 10 overall. Austin Hope is clearly doing something right when it comes it comes to their wine, but you should also know how to properly serve specific wines to truly experience what the winemaker intended. Serving Cabernet Sauvignon What Temperature Should Cabernet Sauvignon Be Served At? We’ve all heard the saying that red wine should be served at room temperature while white wine should be served chill, but did you know that’s a myth? Red wine is best served slightly cooler than room temperature, but not at the low temperatures that normal refrigerators are typically set at. The ideal serving temperature for a cabernet sauvignon wine is going to be around 60-degrees Fahrenheit, but Austin Hope likes to suggest serving it at 57-58 degrees for the best flavor. So if you’ve been storing your wine in a wine fridge you may have to let it warm up just a bit before serving and if you’ve been storing it at room temperature, a quick rest in your kitchen refrigerator for about 30 minutes should bring the wine down to the ideal temperature. There’s nothing wrong with serving cabernet sauvignon at room temperature if that’s what you’re used to, but if you really want to get the full experience and the full flavor profiles, it’s best to chill it for just a little while before serving.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/i-put-ice-in-my-wine-because-you-dont-serve-it-at-the-right-temperature-12315712/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"I Put Ice in My Wine Because You Don't Serve it at the Right ...

McAlpine August 2, 2012 Photo courtesy of Flickr user 96dpi “A glass of the Chianti. With ice on the side.” While I’ve had more than a few raised eyebrows shot in my direction for willingly diluting my red wines with ice, my distaste for the acetic sting that accompanies warm wine far outweighs my concern for thinning out my drink with a cube or two of ice. I’ve often wondered about the age-old “rule” that red wine should be served at room temperature, while white wines should be served chilled. Personally, I’ve always found room temperature red wine to be, well, repulsive. It turns out that my uncouth icing of the reds is not completely unjustified. Most red wines are served too warm; the “room temperature” rule originated in Europe, where room temperature is between 60 and 65 degrees Fahrenheit. On the other hand, chilled white wine came from the European cellar, where temperatures hover around 55 degrees Fahrenheit. In America, to achieve the ideal wine temperature you actually have to cool red wines and warm white wines, assuming your reds are stored in a room temperature wine rack and your whites are kept cold (too cold!) in the refrigerator. Average room temperatures can be over 70 degrees and most refrigerators are a frosty 35 degrees Fahrenheit. One critic recommends putting a bottle of red wine in the fridge for 45 minutes before serving while taking a bottle of white wine out of the fridge 30 minutes prior to serving. The reason temperature is so important to bringing out the flavor of wines is that warming or chilling wine can unlock different layers of flavors within the wine.

If you plan to store the wine for a long period of time, we suggest putting it onto your wine rack and then trying not to jostle the bottle around as much as possible. This is also why we suggest not storing the wine in your refrigerator until shortly before you intend to drink it. The vibrations from the fridge, or from picking up the bottle multiple times, can also affect the flavor. So if you’re really looking to preserve that special bottle, just set it and forget it. What Temperature Should I Serve Wine at? Most people will argue that, in general, white wine is supposed to be served chilled and red wine is supposed to be served at around room temperature, but that’s not always the case according to wine experts. Red Wine Serving Temperature This notion that red wine is supposed to be served at “room temperature” has been floating around for ages. And because this idea has been around for so long, the ideal “room temperature” has changed over the years. While today our “room temperature” usually hovers around 72-73 degrees Fahrenheit, in the past it would refer to temperatures in the mid-50’s to low 60’s. And because of this change over the years, you’re probably serving your red wine a bit too warm. Most red wine is meant to be served between 55-65 degrees Fahrenheit to help maintain the intended flavor of the wine. If you’re wine is too warm the alcohol taste can push through making it sting a bit when drank, while too cold and the tannins in the wine can shine through too much. The temperature in which red wine should be served can be subjective depending on your personal tastes, but in general 55-65 degrees is the sweet spot for red wine. This will allow the wine flavors to balance nicely without throwing off the taste.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d6\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.wsetglobal.com/knowledge-centre/blog/2022/april/26/ideal-serving-temperatures-and-top-tips-for-wine-storage\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Ideal serving temperatures and top tips for wine storage Ideal serving temperatures and top tips for wine storage When you hear the expression serve at room temperature, what number comes to mind? While the Oxford English Dictionary states that room temperature is conventionally taken as about 20 °C (68 °F), it might actually surprise you to discover that what's referred to as ‘room temperature for wines’ might leave you reaching for a sweatshirt, as it's actually, a bit cooler: 15 to 18 °C (59–64 °F). What we've come to expect as normal room temperature for us is actually quite a bit warmer than the optimal serving temperature for wines. With the widespread use of air conditioning and central heating, rooms can often be either too hot or even sometimes too cold. How to serve wine at the correct temperature So why do we talk about service temperature? Generally speaking, wines show their best and the fullest expression of their styles and flavours when served at particular temperatures. What temperature should you serve red wines? Full-bodied red wines should be served at room temperature. If reds are too cold, they may taste thin and harsh. Although you might be tempted to warm a red quickly, perhaps by placing it near a radiator, sudden exposure to extreme heat can permanently damage the wine. Instead, a good way to gently warm a wine is to hold the bowl of the glass in your hands. If these wines are served at a temperature, exceeding 18°C (64 °F), they can appear to lose their freshness and their flavour structure can become muddled. However, so long as they haven’t been heated too quickly, once they’ve cooled to the optimal service temperature, they should regain their balance. Top Tip: Remember that an ice bucket should always be three-quarters filled with equal quantities of ice and water so that the bottle of wine is fully surrounded by iced water. The water is then able to transfer the heat from the bottle to melt the ice. Air acts as an insulator and a bottle in ice alone will chill very slowly until some of the ice has melted.

So here in the Philippines, we would definitely need to chill our red wines before drinking. With that being said, let’s do a rundown of the main types of wine and what their best serving temperature's are. Sweet Wine & Sparkling Wine Sweet or sparkling wine should be refrigerated before serving. The ideal serving temperature for these wines should be 10°C or lower: we recommend refrigerating for an hour to two before serving. Add some flair to your presentation and serve it in a pretty ice bucket to maintain this temperature. No ice bucket? Use a wine cooler. White Wine White wine such as Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, and other lighter colored white wines should be served between 7-12°C , chilling it at least 1 and a half hours before serving. By chilling white wines it helps maintain the acidity as well as its fresh and crisp flavor. Chardonnay, on the other hand, considered more full-bodied in flavor, does not need to be served as cold as the other white wines on this list. Simply chill for an hour before serving to maintain the bold and fruity flavor. Red Wine Red wine such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Shiraz need to be served at room temperature (in cold countries, that is!). Therefore, refrigerating them for 30 minutes is recommended. When wine such as these are served too warm, the acid overpowers your taste buds. Chianti, Pinot Noir, and other light to medium-bodied red wines may be chilled to reach up to 16°C or for a maximum of one hour.

However, full-bodied reds or wines served in cooler climates may be enjoyed closer to 64°F, which aligns with traditional European room temperatures [d1][d6][d7]. This means that while the phrase 'room temperature' can apply in colder environments, most red wines benefit from being lightly chilled before serving in warmer settings [d2][d4][d7].\n[[END-OF-ANSWER]]"}]}

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Everything About The Greek Mati - Evil Eye The famous Greek Mati or the evil eye is one of the most imporant symbols in Greek folklore. It has a long history and you can find various types of evil eye gifts online or in Greek souvenir shops. There is no way that you have never seen it on various souvenirs if you ever walked in a Greek tourist area. Mati meaning and symbolism of these evil eye gifts So what does the Greek eye mean? The Evil Eye (Kako Mati in Greek) is the belief that certain individuals possess the 'power' to cast a specific type of stare, whether intentional or not, that can cause others to become 'sick.' It is a glare - curse. Mysterious energy that comes against you from another persons eyes. It can be the result of great admiration (or jealousy) - so especially beautiful women or cute kids are the “victims” of the evil eye. The Evil eye on various artifacts (like charms or jewelry) is supposed to absorb this negative and evil energy, so it works like a shield against this mysterious power. There is a twist: according to tradition, you can be affected by the evil eye only if you believe in the existence of the evil eye!

The “mati” (evil eye) is known to be a source of negative energy or a ... The “mati” (evil eye) is known to be a source of negative energy or a strong emotional effect that is directed at another person by an indignant look, or a gaze. The person who passes on the evil eye displays, jealousy, admiration, or hostility towards the other person, however, it is not intentional. The word “vaskania” was also used in ancient Greece to signify envy, jealousy, or admiration. Symptoms of receiving the evil eye are, headaches weakness, dizziness, or the inability to think clearly, and in some circumstances, a twist of fate may occur. In the 1 st century AD, Greek philosopher Plutarch attempted to give a scientific explanation to this phenomenon. He believed that blue eyed people from various regions of the world were better at transmitting this evil spell. This phenomenon spread as Alexander the Great brought the Greek culture to the East. History The belief in the power of the evil eye is not only known in Greek culture but is spread across various cultures and religions around the world, such as the Middle East, West Asia, East and West Africa, and Latin America just to mention a few. The “mati” dates back to Greek classical antiquity in the 6 th century BC when it first emerged on drinking vessels. Eyes were painted on boats and ships sailing the Aegean seas and Greek Islands. This symbolized protection against harmful powers, and also guided ships from hazards. HOW CAN ONE DRIVE AWAY THE EVIL EYE? Greek and other cultures believing in the evil eye wear jewelry such as blue eye-shaped pendants bracelets or rings as they are symbolic to chasing away the mysterious spell. In Greek religion, a ritual can also be performed by reciting a special prayer by a person (healer) who has the gift of knowing the special prayer. The name of the person affected by the mati is mentioned in the prayer and is recited three times. Both the affected person and the healer will yawn and tears will appear during the “xematiasma” process. “Xematiasma” is a Greek word meaning to remove the evil eye.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2022-08-04\"\n  }\n]\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"The Greek translation of 'evil eye' is 'κακό μάτι' or 'διαβολικό μάτι'.\",\n    \"quote\": \"How to say evil eye in Greek - κακό μάτι - WordHippo How to say evil eye in Greek.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label.

Because yeast is killed off in high temperatures, freezing the dough after the first rise and before shaping it into a loaf ensures that it won’t work and the bread won’t rise. Furthermore, freezing the dough after it has risen will allow you to defrost it and make it easier to work with. If you intend to make pizza, leave the dough for at least 30 minutes before cutting. The dough should then be allowed to rest for a few minutes before sticking to the pan. Bread dough can be frozen, which is a great way to keep it or have it on hand if you need it.

Churros: The Ultimate Mexican Pastry Churros are traditionally fried in oil and served as a Mexican snack. When the dough is frozen, it can be fried without having to thaw. Cook frozen churros in the oven for just four minutes. Why Are My Churros Not Crispy? There are a few reasons your churros might not be coming out crispy. The dough might be too thick, which will make for a doughier, less crisp churro. Make sure you’re using a piping bag to get a nice, even thickness of dough. The oil might not be hot enough – churros need to be fried in oil that’s at least 350 degrees Fahrenheit. If the oil isn’t hot enough, the churros will soak up too much oil and become greasy. Finally, make sure you’re dusting the churros with sugar immediately after frying them – this will help create a crisp, sugary crust.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://breadopedia.com/dead-yeast\",\n    \"snippet\": \"How Do I Know If I Killed My Yeast?

The bread won’t rise enough though if you don’t stir it or punch it down enough to let the yeast finish its job before that happens. Will freezing dough kill the yeast? If the yeast was alive when you froze the bread dough, freezing it won’t kill the yeast. However, if you already killed the yeast with incorrect handling, the yeast obviously can’t come back and do its work in the bread when you thaw it and bake it. Can you store yeast in a refrigerator? You can safely refrigerate yeast. Cake yeast can last about two weeks in the refrigerator. Active dry yeast doesn’t need to be refrigerated at all. It can be kept at room temperature for months, though it can be refrigerated, too. It is rehydrated by adding warm water at about 100 to 105 degrees Fahrenheit plus some sugar to feed it. However, if you add water that is below 70 degrees Fahrenheit or 20 degrees Celsius, it may not activate at all. It will eventually rise once the dough sits at room temperature. If the yeast foams, you’ll know that it is alive. It takes about ten minutes to do so. Then it will generate the same gases that make bread the light, airy pastry we love. Instant yeast doesn’t need warm water added to it. You can add it to the dry ingredients in your recipe. Why didn’t my bread rise if the yeast is fine? Yeast takes time to make the bread rise. If it is dead, you’ll obviously be left with leaven bread. Unfortunately, your bread won’t rise much if you don’t add enough yeast or fail to give it enough time to work.

People should seek medical help if their symptoms worsen or if the diarrhea persists for more than 3 days. It is important to note that salmonella can be spread even if the person does not feel sick. Thus, people should take proper precautions even if they have not seen any symptoms as there is still a chance that they can transmit it to others. What temperature kills yeast? Yeast is a living, single-celled organism, and like all living organisms, it has a minimum and maximum temperature at which it can survive and reproduce successfully. Yeast is usually killed off by temperatures higher than 50°C (122°F). This temperature is known as the thermal death point, and it varies for different types of yeast. Although yeast can withstand high temperatures for short periods of time, the temperature should not exceed 50°C (122°F) for extended periods of time. Temperatures below this point, such as 5°C (41°F) render yeast inactive but don’t usually kill it. If temperatures stay at that freezing level, however, yeast will eventually die. Yeast can also be killed by cold temperatures high above its thermal death point, such as freezing temperatures around 0°C (32°F). Is baking yeast poisonous? No, baking yeast is not poisonous. In fact, it is commonly used in baking to leaven dough or make it rise. Though it is a living organism, it is not toxic or harmful when ingested and is often consumed in foods such as beer, wine or bread. Baking yeast is actually a type of fungus that needs nutrients and sugar to grow. When it is added to batter or dough, it begins to break down the sugar and convert it into the gas carbon dioxide, which causes dough to rise. With correct handling, baking yeast can be used safely and should not be a source of concern. Can yeast give you food poisoning? No, yeast does not typically give people food poisoning.

Can Homemade Yeast Rolls Be Frozen? Yes, they can! Here's how I recommend freezing yeast rolls. Freeze the dough after it's risen the first time. Just punch it down, wrap in plastic, put in a plastic freezer-safe bag and stick in the freezer. When ready to use, thaw the dough overnight in the fridge, shape, let rise, then bake. This is a good option if you want to have the dough ready to go for various shapes in the future. Make the roll recipe through the shaping step. Once the rolls are shaped (you don't need to let them rise), place on a freezer-safe pan in one layer and freeze. Once frozen, place the rolls into a freezer-safe bag. When ready to use, place in an oven-safe dish, cover, and let rolls thaw and rise overnight or first thing in the morning in the fridge. This is a good option if you want the dough ready but only want to bake a few at a time. Freeze the baked rolls. Once the rolls have cooled completely after baking, wrap individually or in a group with plastic wrap and place in a freezer-safe bag and freeze. Wrap with foil and reheat in the oven (remove any plastic) from frozen. This is a great way to save leftovers as these rolls reheat in the oven really well.

I would shape and then freeze, but I would only use loaves that were fairly thin in one way or another, a focaccia, fougasse, baguette, etc. so that they would respond quickly to the cold.

Every week I make a large batch of bagel dough for 6 days x enough dough to make 20 bagels for my cafe. I freeze the portions in stainless steel containers belonging to our bain marie. I use quick acting dry yeast. The frozen dough is thawed the day before the proofing and the bagels are made a day after that. The dough works perfectly, but then it has been only frozen for 1 week.

During rehydration the cell membrane recovers, but while this is occurring cell constituents can dissolve in the dough water. The optimum temperature for membrane recovery is about 104°F. Warm rehydration maximizes dry yeast performance by quickly reforming the cell membrane. Cold rehydration hurts performance by slowing down the recovery of the cell membrane and allowing more cell constituents to escape or “leach.” The effect is not that great between 70° and 100°F, but at lower temperatures up to half of the yeast cells’ soluble components can be lost. Leaching affects yeast activity because although most of the enzymes remain, the solubles which promoted the activity of the enzymes are depleted. Leaching also affects dough consistency because glutathione is released. This contributes to dough slackening which can be desirable at low levels in some applications but undesirable in others. \\\" You can put yeast doughs in a very cold refrigerator or freezer, and on being thawed/returned to room temperature, they rise just fine. Same with sourdough starters that have been refrigerated or frozen. So being in the presence of water and cold hasn't killed the yeast--or at least not all of it--in those cases. How is putting dry yeast into cold water different? I get that the yeast won't really activate until it reaches a certain temperature, but have you really killed it?

Usually when one wants to make a dough that is to be frozen, the common practice (the one used by commercial producers of frozen dough balls) is to dramatically increase the amount of yeast. This is done because freezing will kill some of the yeast. Typically, the amount of yeast is doubled or even tripled from what one would use to make a non-frozen dough. However, in your case, increasing the amount of yeast was not an option because the dough recipe you used calls for fermenting the dough at room temperature for 18 hours. That is why the amount of yeast in that recipe (around 0.20%) is so small. Anything much greater than that would probably cause overfermentation. Also, the salt level is on the high side. That is typical of what is used with long, room temperature fermented doughs, with a good example being room temperature fermented Neapolitan style doughs. The high level of salt (2.23% in your case) helps control the rate of fermentation (by suppressing yeast performance) so that the dough doesn't ferment too fast. After the 18 hours of room temperature fermentation, you might have been able to successfully freeze the dough balls had you kept any further fermentation of the dough to a minimum. Usually, it is only necessary to defrost a frozen dough ball for about a day if kept in the main part of your refrigerator, or less if the dough ball is defrosted at room temperature.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d9\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.the-girl-who-ate-everything.com/lion-house-rolls/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Lion House Rolls Recipe (+VIDEO) - The Girl Who Ate Everything WHAT TEMPERATURE SHOULD THE WATER BE FOR THE YEAST TO RISE? The most common mistake when working with yeast is getting the water temperature right. If your water is too cold the yeast won't activate. If it's too hot it will kill the yeast. Technically the water temperature should be around 116 degrees F. Most people don't measure the temperature. Think of the temperature of water if you were to bath a baby. You would want it to be warm enough but not hot. How do you know if it worked? If your yeast proofs correctly it should look all foamy. I've noticed it helps to cover the bowl with a towel while it's proofing. If it's not foaming, your yeast is not activated or you killed it. Start over before wasting your ingredients on the rest of the rolls. Note: You can freeze shaped rolls for later use. After the first rise, shape the rolls but do not rise again. Instead, place rolls on a baking sheet and immediately place in freezer. When dough is frozen solid, remove rolls from pan and place in a plastic bag, squeeze excess air out of bag and seal. Rolls can be frozen for 3 weeks. To bake after freezing, let rolls rise in a warm place until doubled. This could take up to 2 hours since they are frozen. Bake as directed.

As it turns out, freezing temperatures do not kill all the yeast and lactic acid bacteria in a preferment. Some die, but most remain dormant while frozen. The key is to know how to “wake it up” properly and to feed it well so it comes back strong and ready to leaven. There are a lot of great reasons to try freezing your sourdough starter. Using a frozen preferment affords an almost instant starter; even with the added thawing and feeding time required, it provides a significant time savings over starting one from scratch. Having a preferment ready to go is convenient—you can freeze it in portions and just thaw what you need—and frees you from a feeding schedule. There’s no need to worry about entrusting someone with your starter when you go on vacation. Our experiments demonstrated that a frozen levain will perform well for up to 2 weeks after freezing it. Eventually the ice crystals in the frozen preferment grow big enough to damage the yeasts and bacteria, rendering them useless for leavening. If you have levain that has been frozen for more than 2 weeks, you can still use it in combination with commercial yeast. The less-active levain will still provide your bread with complex flavor, and the yeast makes the dough rise. Tips for Freezing Levain Working with frozen levain is simple, although freezing your starter involves more than throwing it in a jar and stashing it in the freezer. Here are a few recommendations to help you get you started. Tip 1: Freeze your preferment immediately after you make it.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Lennon himself was critical of the track. \\\"It's a throwaway, a piece of garbage, I always thought,\\\" he once said. \\\"I always had the TV on very low in the background when I was writing, and it came over, and then I wrote the song.\\\"[7] Recording The basic track was recorded on 8 February 1967, with overdubs on 16 February (bass guitar and lead vocals), 13 March (brass section), 28 March (backing vocals and guitar solo), and 29 March (animal noises).[8] The guitar solo was played by Paul McCartney on a Fender Esquire.[8][9][10] At Lennon's request, George Martin brought in Sounds Incorporated to provide the song's prominent brass backing.[6] Take eight, which contains Lennon's vocals from the subsequent session but also omits animal sounds, was released on Anthology 2 in 1996. Lennon asked engineer Geoff Emerick to arrange the animal noises heard at beginning (and end) of the song so that each animal heard was one capable of devouring (or frightening) the animal preceding it.[6][9] The final sound effect of a chicken clucking was so placed that it transforms into the guitar on the following track, \\\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)\\\". According to Emerick, these animal noises were inspired by the coda of \\\"Caroline, No\\\" that ended the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds album.[11] They begin with the crow of a rooster, while the other animal sounds heard at the end of the song include birds, a cat, a dog, a cow, a horse, a sheep, a group of bloodhounds accompanying fox hunters on horseback with horns blasting, and a chicken. The rapid 16th note bass drum fills were done on two bass drums, according to Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn.[12] The length of the mono version of \\\"Good Morning Good Morning\\\" is 2:35, whereas the stereo version (due to a lengthier fade out of animal sounds) runs to 2:41.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vScqM1jgCHc\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Good Morning - YouTube Provided to YouTube by The state51 Conspiracy Good Morning · Judy Garland · Judy Garland You‚Äôll Never Walk Alone ℗ 2007 River Records ...\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2020-04-29\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d5\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuDY5giH3_s\",\n    \"snippet\": \"PJ Morton - Good Morning (Official Video) (feat.

Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Rivastigmine can also be applied as a patch. Treatment - Alzheimer's disease Contents There's currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease. But there is medicine available that can temporarily reduce the symptoms. Support is also available to help someone with the condition, and their family, cope with everyday life. Medicines A number of medicines may be prescribed for Alzheimer's disease to help temporarily improve some symptoms. The main medicines are: Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors These medicines increase levels of acetylcholine, a substance in the brain that helps nerve cells communicate with each other. They can currently only be prescribed by specialists, such as psychiatrists or neurologists. They may be prescribed by a GP on the advice of a specialist, or by GPs that have particular expertise in their use. Donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine can be prescribed for people with early- to mid-stage Alzheimer's disease. Rivastigmine can also be applied as a patch. The latest guidelines recommend that these medicines should be continued in the later, severe, stages of the disease. There's no difference in how well each of the 3 different AChE inhibitors work, although some people respond better to certain types or have fewer side effects, which can include nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite. The side effects usually get better after 2 weeks of taking the medicine. Memantine This medicine is not an AChE inhibitor. It works by blocking the effects of an excessive amount of a chemical in the brain called glutamate. Memantine is used for moderate or severe Alzheimer's disease. It's suitable for those who cannot take or are unable to tolerate AChE inhibitors. It's also suitable for people with severe Alzheimer’s disease who are already taking an AChE inhibitor. Side effects can include headaches, dizziness and constipation but these are usually only temporary. For more information about the possible side effects of your specific medicine, read the patient information leaflet that comes with it or speak to your doctor.

Sometimes other medicines such as antidepressants may be prescribed to help manage the behavioral symptoms linked to Alzheimer's disease. Creating a safe and supportive environment An important part of any treatment plan is to adapt to the needs of a person with Alzheimer's disease. Create routine habits and cut down on tasks that require memory. These steps can make life much easier. These are ways to support a person's sense of well-being and ability to function: Keep keys, wallets, mobile phones and other valuables in the same place at home so they don't become lost. Keep medicines in a secure location. Use a daily checklist to keep track of doses. Arrange for finances to be on automatic payment and automatic deposit. Have the person with Alzheimer's carry a mobile phone with location tracking. Program important phone numbers into the phone. Install alarm sensors on doors and windows. Make sure regular appointments are on the same day at the same time as much as possible. Use a calendar or whiteboard to track daily schedules. Build the habit of checking off completed items. Remove furniture, clutter and throw rugs that aren't needed. Install sturdy handrails on stairs and in bathrooms. Ensure that shoes and slippers are comfortable and provide good traction. Reduce the number of mirrors. People with Alzheimer's may find images in mirrors confusing or scary. Make sure that the person with Alzheimer's carries ID or wears a medical alert bracelet.

Alzheimer's treatments: What's on the horizon? Current Alzheimer's treatments temporarily improve symptoms of memory loss and problems with thinking and reasoning. These Alzheimer's treatments boost the performance of chemicals in the brain that carry information from one brain cell to another. They include cholinesterase inhibitors and the medicine memantine (Namenda). However, these treatments don't stop the underlying decline and death of brain cells. As more cells die, Alzheimer's disease continues to progress. Experts are cautious but hopeful about developing treatments that can stop or delay the progression of Alzheimer's. Experts continue to better understand how the disease changes the brain. This has led to the research of potential Alzheimer's treatments that may affect the disease process. Future Alzheimer's treatments may include a combination of medicines. This is similar to treatments for many cancers or HIV/AIDS that include more than one medicine. These are some of the strategies currently being studied. Taking aim at plaques Some of the new Alzheimer's treatments target clumps of the protein beta-amyloid, known as plaques, in the brain. Plaques are a characteristic sign of Alzheimer's disease. Strategies aimed at beta-amyloid include: Recruiting the immune system. Medicines known as monoclonal antibodies may prevent beta-amyloid from clumping into plaques. They also may remove beta-amyloid plaques that have formed. They do this by helping the body clear them from the brain. These medicines mimic the antibodies your body naturally produces as part of your immune system's response to foreign invaders or vaccines. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved lecanemab (Leqembi) and donanemab (Kisunla) for people with mild Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease.

Your provider may also ask someone close to you, like a family member or caregiver, for insight into your symptoms. They’ll ask about: These drugs work by blocking the action of acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme responsible for destroying acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is one of the chemicals that help nerve cells communicate. Researchers believe that reduced levels of acetylcholine cause some of the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. These drugs can improve some memory problems and reduce some behavioral symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. These medications don’t cure Alzheimer’s disease or stop the progression of the disease. Monoclonal antibodies Monoclonal antibodies can help your body’s immune system target and destroy amyloid proteins. This can slow down the progression of Alzheimer’s by getting rid of some of the amyloid before it damages your brain. Like all other treatments, monoclonal antibodies aren’t a cure for Alzheimer’s disease. And they can’t reverse any damage that amyloid has already done. There are two FDA-approved monoclonal antibody treatments available for the treatment of Alzheimer’s: Antipsychotics (neuroleptics): These drugs can treat paranoia, hallucinations and agitation. These medications can cause unpleasant or potentially dangerous side effects (like dizziness, which could lead to falls), so healthcare providers typically only prescribe them for short periods when behavioral problems are severe.

Learn more: PMC Disclaimer | PMC Copyright Notice Abstract Disease-modifying treatment strategies for Alzheimer disease (AD) are still under extensive research. Nowadays, only symptomatic treatments exist for this disease, all trying to counterbalance the neurotransmitter disturbance: 3 cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine. To block the progression of the disease, therapeutic agents are supposed to interfere with the pathogenic steps responsible for the clinical symptoms, classically including the deposition of extracellular amyloid β plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangle formation. Other underlying mechanisms are targeted by neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, growth factor promotive, metabolic efficacious agents and stem cell therapies. Recent therapies have integrated multiple new features such as novel biomarkers, new neuropsychological outcomes, enrollment of earlier populations in the course of the disease, and innovative trial designs. In the near future different specific agents for every patient might be used in a “precision medicine” context, where aberrant biomarkers accompanied with a particular pattern of neuropsychological and neuroimaging findings could determine a specific treatment regimen within a customized therapeutic framework. In this review, we discuss potential disease-modifying therapies that are currently being studied and potential individualized therapeutic frameworks that can be proved beneficial for patients with AD.

Although current medications cannot cure Alzheimer's, two U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatments address the underlying biology. Other medications may help lessen symptoms, such as memory loss and confusion. FDA-approved drugs for Alzheimer's The FDA has approved medications that fall into two categories: drugs that change disease progression in people living with early Alzheimer's disease, and drugs that may temporarily mitigate some symptoms of Alzheimer's dementia. When considering any treatment, it is important to have a conversation with a health care professional to determine whether it is appropriate. A clinician who is experienced in using these types of medications should monitor people who are taking them and ensure that the recommended guidelines are strictly observed. Drugs that change disease progression Drugs in this category slow disease progression by going after the underlying biology of the disease process. They aim to slow the decline of memory and thinking, as well as function, in people living with Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid-targeting approaches Anti-amyloid treatments work by removing beta-amyloid, a protein that accumulates into plaques, from the brain. Each works differently and targets beta-amyloid at a different stage of plaque formation. These treatments change the course of the disease in a meaningful way for people in the early stages, giving them more time to participate in daily life and live independently. Clinical trial participants who received anti-amyloid treatments experienced reduction in cognitive decline observed through measures of cognition and function. Examples of cognition measures include: Memory. Orientation. Examples of functional measures include: Conducting personal finances. Performing household chores such as cleaning. Anti-amyloid treatments do have side effects. These treatments can cause serious allergic reactions. Side effects can also include amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), infusion-related reactions, headaches and falls. ARIA is a common side effect that does not usually cause symptoms but can be serious.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only.

The notion that entropy may “decrease” in some open systems or in life processes, or on small space and time scales, and thus violate the Second Law is misleading and inaccurate. Local entropy decrease, due to entropy outflow with heat (thermodynamic entropy is associated with thermal motion, i.e., thermal energy or heat only), should not be confused with impossibility of entropy “reduction by destruction”.

In other words, the more ordered a system is, the less information it contains. Entropy generates information. For example, you have a deck of cards, stacked neatly, and in order. How long would it take you to describe that system with enough information to replicate it exactly? Well, I just did. Now take that deck of card and toss it in the air. Describe the end result so that it could be replicated exactly. That is very hard to do. The more chaos there is in a system, the more “information” it contains. So by increasing entropy we are increasing information. How does this apply to life? Well life contains an immense amount of information. A single strand of DNA can contain 700 terabytes of information, although most contain much less (1.5 GB or about two CDs). But, in our cells there is massive redundancy, so each cell contains a complete copy of this information. So, since the universe is trying to maximize both entropy (disorder) and information, one might argue that life is a side effect of that process, and that the purpose of life is to increase the retention of information, by encoding it into matter rather than energy. Ergo, evolution is basically driven by the fundamental law of the universe that is increasing both entropy and information. It is estimated that life appeared on earth some 100 million years after its formation. However, a single bacterium contains a lot of complex information. 100 million years is a long time, but I was always struck by how little life changed between the moment it evolved (100 million years after Earth’s formation), to the first eukaryotes to appear (1.5 billion years later). It seems like life evolved very rapidly, then very slowly. Also, if life evolved that easily, there should be complex life everywhere in the universe, and we should be easily able to recreate things in the lab. Neither of which has proven to be true. Someone much smarter than me decided that information theory might have a good answer. Genetic material in DNA can be represented as information.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://virtuallaboratory.colorado.edu/CLUE-Chemistry/chapters/chapter5txt-6.html\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Chemistry, life, the universe and everything Now let us return to the situation with solids, liquids, and gases. How do we think about entropy in these systems? Doesn’t a substance become more ordered as we move it from gas to liquid to solid? Clearly the entropy of a solid is lower than that of a liquid (and the entropy of a liquid is lower than that of a gas). We can calculate how entropies change for materials as they go from gas to liquid to solid, and as we have predicted they decrease. How can it be that a change in which the entropy of the system decreases (for example freezing of ice) can occur? Are we forced to conclude that things we know to happen are impossible according to the Second Law of Thermodynamics? The Second Law of Thermodynamics tells us that for every change that occurs, the entropy of the universe must increase. The problem with this is that we are all well aware of changes where the entropy apparently decreases. How can we resolve this seeming paradox? The answer lies in the fact that for any system the entropy may indeed decrease - water freezing is an example of this phenomenon. However for the universe as a whole (or more easily defined, the system and its surroundings) total entropy must increase. Consider when water freezes, the water molecules form stable interactions (hydrogen bonds). As we have seen previously, the formation of stabilizing interactions lowers the potential energy of the system. Because energy is conserved, this energy must be released to the surroundings as thermal (kinetic) energy. That is, the freezing of water is an exothermic process. Now we can see the solution to our thermodynamic problem. The reason that the freezing of water does not violate the second law is because even though the system (ice) becomes more ordered and has lower entropy, the energy that is released to the surroundings makes those molecules move faster, which leads to an increase in the entropy of the surroundings. The increase in entropy in the surroundings is greater than the decrease in entropy of the ice! When we consider both system and surroundings, the change in entropy (ΔS) is positive.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d5\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Computational Foundations for the Second Law of Thermodynamics ... The Heat Death of the Universe It didn’t take long after the Second Law was first proposed for people to start talking about its implications for the long-term evolution of the universe. If “randomness” (for example as characterized by entropy) always increases, doesn’t that mean that the universe must eventually evolve to a state of “equilibrium randomness”, in which all the rich structures we now see have decayed into “random heat”? There are several issues here. But the most obvious has to do with what observer one imagines will be experiencing that future state of the universe. After all, if the underlying rules which govern the universe are reversible, then in principle it will always be possible to go back from that future “random heat” and reconstruct from it all the rich structures that have existed in the history of the universe. But the point of the Second Law as we’ve discussed it is that at least for computationally bounded observers like us that won’t be possible. The past will always in principle be determinable from the future, but it will take irreducibly much computation to do so—and vastly more than observers like us can muster. And along the same lines, if observers like us examine the future state of the universe we won’t be able to see that there’s anything special about it. Even though it came from the “special state” that is the current state of our universe, we won’t be able to tell it from a “typical” state, and we’ll just consider it “random”. But what if the observers evolve with the evolution of the universe? Yes, to us today that future configuration of particles may just “look random”. But in actuality, it has rich computational content that there’s no reason to assume a future observer will not find in some way or another significant. Indeed, in a sense the longer the universe has been around, the larger the amount of irreducible computation it will have done. And, yes, observers like us today might not care about most of what comes out of that computation. But in principle there are features of it that could be mined to inform the “experience” of future observers. At a practical level, our basic human senses pick out certain features on certain scales.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d6\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/07/18/magazine/herman-daly-interview.html\",\n    \"snippet\": \"This Pioneering Economist Says Our Obsession With Growth Must ... I think there is. I learned from my old professor Georgescu-Roegen that it’s matter and low-entropy energy. You need matter and energy to accomplish your physical ends. But the first law of thermodynamics says that matter and energy can never be destroyed or created. You can change its form, and all processes change that form from low-entropy, useful energy to high-entropy, useless energy. Our ultimate means are constrained by the entropy law. But is there an ultimate end? That’s harder to answer. Can you give it a shot for me? I think we’re all in the position where we have to try to answer it for ourselves. But I can rule out the current answer, which is that growth is the ultimate end. Now, instead of that you could say spiritual improvement is the ultimate end. That gets you into fundamental religious questions: What is the meaning of life? Where did I come from? What’s going to happen when I die? These are questions people used to think of as fundamental. Now they’re marginal, unscientific. My critique of economics as it exists today would be that it is too materialistic because it does not consider the relationship between the ultimate ends and the intermediate ends. At the same time, economics is not materialistic enough because it also refuses to deal with the ultimate means. It doesn’t ask questions about the fundamental limits of the entropic nature of the world, of matter and energy and adapting to these physical limits. Let me stick with ultimate ends for a second. What do you think the meaning of life is? Everyone has an answer to that, even if it’s just to punt, but I’m a Christian. I do think there’s a creator. I don’t think that you can say life is an accident, which is really what scientific materialism says. Neo-Darwinism has gotten a free ride philosophically for a long time. When you calculate the compound probability of all these infinitesimally probable events happening at once to generate life, it becomes quite absurd.

This is vital to understanding what happens in our Universe. We don’t need some miraculously low-entropy state to occur to begin our Universe or to begin the process of inflation. All we need is for inflation to arise in some part of the Universe and for that space to begin inflating. In short order — after no more than a tiny fraction of a second — no matter how much entropy there initially was, that entropy is now spread out over a much larger volume. Entropy may always be increasing, but the entropy density, or the amount of entropy contained in the volume that will someday become our entire observable Universe, drops to this extremely low value: about 10 nanojoules-per-Kelvin, spread out over the volume of a soccer ball. During an inflationary period (green), world lines get stretched by the exponential expansion, ...

When inflation ends, the field energy locked up in inflation gets converted into particles, resulting in an enormous entropy increase. Ned Wright's Cosmology Tutorial/annotations by E. Siegel When inflation ends, that field energy gets converted into matter, antimatter and radiation: that hot, dense, almost uniform, and expanding-but-cooling Universe. Converting that field energy into particles causes the entropy within our observable Universe to rise dramatically: by about 73 orders of magnitude. Over the next 13.8 billion years, as our Universe expanded, cooled, fused, gravitated, formed atoms and stars and galaxies and black holes and planets and humans, our entropy “only” rose by 15 or 16 orders of magnitude. What has occurred and what will occur over the entire history of the Universe is peanuts compared to the biggest entropy growth to ever happen: the end of inflation and the beginning of the hot Big Bang. Yet even during that inflationary state with alarmingly low entropy, we still never saw the entropy of the Universe decrease; it was only the entropy density that went down as the volume of the Universe increased exponentially.

First, a sample of the substance is cooled as close to absolute zero as possible. At such temperatures, the entropy approaches zero – due to the definition of temperature. Then, small amounts of heat are introduced into the sample and the change in temperature is recorded, until the temperature reaches a desired value (usually 25 °C). The obtained data allows the user to integrate the equation above, yielding the absolute value of entropy of the substance at the final temperature. This value of entropy is called calorimetric entropy.[91] Entropy is the only quantity in the physical sciences that seems to imply a particular direction of progress, sometimes called an arrow of time. As time progresses, the second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases in large systems over significant periods of time. Hence, from this perspective, entropy measurement is thought of as a clock in these conditions.[citation needed] Chiavazzo et al. proposed that where cave spiders choose to lay their eggs can be explained through entropy minimization.[96] Entropy has been proven useful in the analysis of base pair sequences in DNA. Many entropy-based measures have been shown to distinguish between different structural regions of the genome, differentiate between coding and non-coding regions of DNA, and can also be applied for the recreation of evolutionary trees by determining the evolutionary distance between different species.[97] Assuming that a finite universe is an isolated system, the second law of thermodynamics states that its total entropy is continually increasing. It has been speculated, since the 19th century, that the universe is fated to a heat death in which all the energy ends up as a homogeneous distribution of thermal energy so that no more work can be extracted from any source.

[d1] High-credibility references explain that entropy is continually generated and cannot be destroyed, meaning the universe’s total entropy must always rise [d1][d8]. Additional documents affirm that the total entropy of the universe can never decrease and that time itself flows in the direction of increasing entropy [d4][d7][d2]. Partial discussions further note that all processes convert low-entropy energy into high-entropy forms, reinforcing the same principle [d3][d5][d6].\n[[END-OF-ANSWER]]"}]}

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Not all schools in LA are on the same calendar, but yes, most local schools are on summer break until just after Labor Day which is September 3rd this year so crowds at Disney will probably be large throughout August. School Schedules for the Los Angeles Unified School District start anywhere from the first week in August to the first week in September, add to that all the other school districts in the Southwest (For example, the city of Anaheim, where Disneyland is located has 8 different school districts!). So let's talk averages, a good place to look is at Disneyland itself. their Operating hours for August haven't been posted yet, but the Annual Pass Blockout dates have been. If you look at the Southern California AP, you will see the following expectations by Disney... So The first three weeks in August will be very busy with out-of-town guests, to require them to be blocked out. Then on August 20th, they open up the pass, as they expect smaller crowds. So that is what Disney thinks, they also start cutting back on the hours and entertainment on that date. One issue, a lot of folks are still off school that have that pass, and therefore those first few days can actually become busier than the week before. (They have been blocked out since late June). After Labor Day (Sept. 3rd, 2012) then Disney goes back to off-season hours Disneyland is located in Anaheim which is about a 45 min drive South of the LA area, so its a good idea to also post in the Anaheim forum if you have more Disneyland related questions such as where to stay, ect. It makes no difference what the Los Angeles summer holidays are for schools, as Disneyland is an international destination. August is a summer holiday for all Europeans, and most American schools are out of school in August (going back to school on various dates in August and September). I\\\"ve been to Disneyland a few times, and it always seems busy, we have been in May and June before , but thought August may be a bit busier. They have the fast passes you can use as well anyway don't they, we'll get a 4 day pass so will give us plenty of time to get around.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2012-02-27\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d9\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://mommypoppins.com/los-angeles-kids/preschools-schools/school-calendars-2024-2025-los-angeles\",\n    \"snippet\": \"School Calendars 2024-2025: Start & End Dates for Los Angeles ...

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

The Venetian Ghetto was the area in which Jews were compelled to live under the Venetian Republic. The word ghetto (ghèto), originally Venetian, is now found in many languages. Shakespeare's play The Merchant of Venice, written in the late 16th century, features Shylock, a Venetian Jew. The first complete and uncensored printed edition of the Talmud was printed in Venice by Daniel Bomberg in 1523. During World War II, Jews were rounded up in Venice and deported to extermination camps. Since the end of the war, the Jewish population of Venice has declined from 1500 to about 500.[96] Only around 30 Jews live in the former ghetto, which houses the city's major Jewish institutions.[97]\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2025-02-13\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1454765/venice-population/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Venice: residents by area 1871-2023 - Statista For 15 centuries, this area has been the cornerstone of the city's political, economic, and social life, with a peak of 174,800 residents ...

For 15 centuries, this area has been the cornerstone of the city's political, economic, and social life, with a peak of 174,800 residents reached in 1951. Since then, a substantial decline started in favor of the mainland. In 1960, it became more populous than the ancient settlement for the first time since the founding in the seventh century A.D. Over the last 20 years, the inhabitants of the dry land stabilized around 180,000 people. There they can find better and easily accessible public services and modern infrastructures while avoiding the problem of overtourism. On the contrary, in 2023 only 50,000 inhabitants lived in the center, 72 percent less than in 1952. The population residing in the estuary never exceeded 51,000 people, and the depopulation trend has been constant since the 1990s. The problem of overtourism Tourism is a crucial sector for the city’s economy. It contributes 1.67 billion euros to Venice’s Gross Domestic Product, and more than 1,260 hotels are located within the municipality. Despite being its largest economic resource, tourism has gradually become one of the greatest threats to Venice’s survival. Less than 50,000 people reside in the historical city center, which was visited by almost six million tourists in 2023.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-09-18\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://worldpopulationreview.com/cities/italy/venice\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Venice, Italy Population 2024 Venice's 2024 population is now estimated at 257,777.

In 2011, the population of Venice was 261,362. Venice, Italy is known for being one of the most beautiful and remarkable cities on the planet. It is in northern Italy and is made up of 118 small islands with each one connected by canals and bridges. The city is quite a thing to behold and it can be strange to think of the city as anything beyond a tourist's dream, but there are of course people who live in the city full time. Venice is not the largest city in Italy, but is certainly among the most visited. City Size and Population Density The city of Venice covers a surface area of approximately 414.57 km² (160.07 sq mi). The population density comes to about 630/km² (1,600/sq mi). Demographics of Population in Venice Venice is the 11th largest city in Italy and, although it has a considerable tourist population, there are 270,884 permanent residents I the city. The overall population is divided into 47.4% men and 52.6% women, with 14.36% of the population falling under the age of 18. Those receiving a pension make up 19.94% of the population, but the average age of residents within Venice is 46, which is four years older than the average age of residents in the whole of Italy. Tourism in Venice Tourism is one of the main industries in Venice. Although many residents feel as though tourists can be a nuisance, they cannot ignore the fact that tourism is vital to the city's survival. It is estimated that approximately 20 million tourists visit Venice annually and that number only increases as each year passes.

In the following decades, the municipality registered a slow but constant decline of residents, loosing 115,492 citizens in 55 years, especially in the historical city center. Depopulation of the historical city center Venice is one of the most visited cities in Italy. The San Marco square and the hundreds of bridges that connect the 118 islands of the historical city center attracted 5.7 million people in 2023. However, given its geographical peculiarity, Venice is a fragile environment that must face the serious problem of overtourism. In fact, the city has the second-highest number of tourists per inhabitant in Europe. As a result, Venice is overcrowded and environmental pollution has risen, substantially decreasing the life quality of residents. Accessing to essential public services has become more difficult for inhabitants, and residential properties have been converted to accommodation facilities. As many residents have decided to relocate to the dry land, the historical city center recorded a dramatic depopulation trend. In 2023, less than 50,000 people still lived in the lagoon. Venice and Veneto: not only tourism Venice is the administrative center of Veneto, one of the most economically developed regions of the country. Veneto’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) amounted to 180.5 billion euros in 2022.

An island city, it was once the centre of a maritime republic. It was the greatest seaport in late medievalEurope and the continent’s commercial and cultural link to Asia. Venice is unique environmentally, architecturally, and historically, and in its days as a republic the city was styled la serenissima (“the most serene” or “sublime”). It remains a major Italian port in the northern Adriatic Sea and is one of the world’s oldest tourist and cultural centres. Since the fall of the Venetian republic in 1797, the city has held an unrivaled place in the Western imagination and has been endlessly described in prose and verse. The luminous spectacle of ornate marbled and frescoed palaces, bell towers, and domes reflected in the sparkling waters of the lagoon under a blue Adriatic sky has been painted, photographed, and filmed to such an extent that it is difficult to distinguish the real city from its romantic representations. The visitor arriving in Venice is still transported into another world, one whose atmosphere and beauty remain incomparable. Today Venice is recognized as part of the artistic and architectural patrimony of all humanity, a fitting role for a city whose thousand-year economic and political independence was sustained by its role in global trading. The situation of the city on islands has limited modern suburban spread beyond the historic centre; its framework of canals and narrow streets has prevented the intrusion of automobiles; and its unmatched wealth of fine buildings and monuments dating from the period of commercial dominance has ensured a keen and almost universal desire for sensitive conservation. This concern for conservation is now extended not just to the city’s monuments but to the very city itself, as rising water levels and subsidence of the land upon which Venice is built threaten the continued existence of the city in its present form.

The remaining inhabitants of Venice’s historic centre said they fear becoming like “relics in an open museum” now that the population is expected to drop below 50,000 for the first time. Once the heart of a powerful maritime republic, Venice’s main island has lost more than 120,000 residents since the early 1950s, driven away by myriad issues but mainly a focus on mass tourism that has caused the population to be dwarfed by the thousands of visitors who crowd its squares, bridges and narrow walkways each day. Venessia.com, an activist group that for years has campaigned to preserve Venice’s heritage, has kept track of the population decline and said the figure, now at 50,011, would fall below 50,000 by Friday. “We don’t have a precise number but, according to our calculations, and using data from the civil registry, it will go below 50,000,” said Matteo Secchi, who leads Venessia.com. “We have been warning about this for years … we don’t want to give up, but no administration has managed to reverse the trend.” Secchi said that those who remain feel “suffocated” by an “economic machine” that has focused on tourism. He said it had left residents grappling with a high cost of living, a lack of affordable housing, and led to businesses that sell essential items being replaced by souvenir shops. “Tourism is a double-edged sword because you take money but at the same time you expel all the activities and space for [the residents],” said Secchi, who described Venice as “a cash machine”. “There are those who are not from here but own a home, rent it out and then spend the money elsewhere.” Venice authorities this year announced a plan to attract remote workers to the city, but it appears to have made little impact. “This kind of thing is OK, but we need an epochal change and for the council to bring in significant measures, such as offering financial incentives to property owners who, say, only rent to Venetians,” said Secchi. “The danger is that we are becoming extinct,\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2022-08-10\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d8\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-population-of-Venice-Do-people-choose-to-live-there-now-or-move-there\",\n    \"snippet\": \"What is the population of Venice?

Update: as of early April 2024 the population of Venice is now under 49.000, a thousand persons less than one year ago. Population decline In 1951, the city of Venice had almost 175,000 inhabitants. That is a number well in line with the historical population levels for many centuries back. In 2022, the population of Venice was lower than 50,000 for the first time since the Middle Ages. That is a drop of seventy per cent in seventy years. Or maybe, rather than talk about a ‘drop’ of the population, we should talk about a collapse of the population. The decline in population shows no signs of relenting. The city is consistently losing about one thousand inhabitants each year. The number is steadily ticking downwards. The reasons for the decline are complex, so the discussion below is necessarily a simplification and a generalisation. Jobs in industry The economy of Venice changed in the years after WWII. The commercial harbour moved to the mainland in Marghera, and industry followed. The area had been built up before the war, both for industry and housing for the workers, but the place only took off after the war. Young people searching for a steady job headed to Marghera in large numbers. There they could find a job in industry, buy a house, start a family. Their parents would often remain in the old home in Venice. Their children, born in the 1960s and 1970s, grew up on the mainland.

However, the historical center or lagoon area of Venice has far fewer residents, with about 50,000 people in 2023 and under 49,000 by early 2024 [d2][d4][d7][d9]. These numbers complement each other, reflecting the difference between the broader municipality and the smaller island core of the city [d1][d2][d5][d9].\n[[END-OF-ANSWER]]"}]}

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only.

The South Asia Crisis and the Founding of Bangladesh, 1971 In 1971, an internal crisis in Pakistan resulted in a third war between India and Pakistan and the secession of East Pakistan, creating the independent state of Bangladesh. These events altered the relationship between the United States and the region. Last President of a united Pakistan Yahya Khan with President Richard Nixon. (Richard Nixon Library) The partition of India in 1947 created West and East Pakistan, two noncontiguous territories that shared a dominant religion of Islam but were very different in terms of language, ethnicity and culture. In the 1970 parliamentary elections, an overwhelming number of East Pakistanis voted for a political party that advocated autonomy for the East, but it was blocked from governing by the Army and the existing Pakistani government, and its leader was jailed. The resulting mass protests in the East were brutally suppressed by the Pakistani Army, which caused a massive refugee movement into neighboring India. East Pakistani guerilla forces, supported by India, fought with the Pakistani Army in the late autumn of 1971. West Pakistan responded with air attacks on India, resulting in open war between the two powers beginning on December 3. The United States faced several dilemmas in how to respond to the crisis. The regional situation was already complex. India signed a treaty of mutual assistance with the Soviet Union in August, 1971, and the People’s Republic of China was friendly to Pakistan and had fought a war with India in 1962. However, Pakistan was a valuable diplomatic partner, and its government helped the United States achieve a rapprochement with the People’s Republic of China in the early 1970s.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Richard Nixon - Wikipedia He covertly aided Pakistan during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971 and ...

On taking office in 1969, he stepped up covert operations against Cuba and its president, Fidel Castro. He maintained close relations with the Cuban-American exile community through his friend, Bebe Rebozo, who often suggested ways of irritating Castro. The Soviets and Cubans became concerned, fearing Nixon might attack Cuba and break the understanding between Kennedy and Khrushchev that ended the missile crisis. In August 1970, the Soviets asked Nixon to reaffirm the understanding, which he did, despite his hard line against Castro. The process was not completed before the Soviets began expanding their base at the Cuban port of Cienfuegos in October 1970. A minor confrontation ensued, the Soviets stipulated they would not use Cienfuegos for submarines bearing ballistic missiles, and the final round of diplomatic notes were exchanged in November.[183] The election of Marxist candidate Salvador Allende as President of Chile in September 1970 spurred a vigorous campaign of covert opposition to him by Nixon and Kissinger.[184]: 25 This began by trying to convince the Chilean congress to confirm Jorge Alessandri as the winner of the election, and then messages to military officers in support of a coup.[184] Other support included strikes organized against Allende and funding for Allende opponents.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2025-01-10\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kissinger-nixon-broke-us-rule-to-help-pakistan-sent-aircraft-from-third-countries-as-they-feared-india-was-about-to-attack-west-pakistan/article67591823.ece\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Kissinger, Nixon 'helped' Pakistan in 1971, documents from U.S. ...

The information was part of a bunch of documents that were declassified earlier but were circulated by the National Security Archive of the U.S.A. on Thursday to mark Prof. Kissinger’s demise at the age of 100. The documents have shed renewed light on the crucial 13 days in the first fortnight of December 1971 and has revealed that Nixon-Kissinger duo was worried about India launching an all-out war against Pakistan and wanted to prevent “crumbling” of the Pakistani state. A cable of December 4, a day after the war started, shows that the U.S. administration had come to believe that the war was started with India attacking Pakistan and that President Yahya Khan had sent an urgent appeal for military help from Washington DC. In course of the conversation, Kissinger is quoted as saying: “We have had an urgent appeal from Yahya. Says his military supplies have been cut off — in very bad shape.” Kissinger then asked President Nixon: “Would we help through Iran?” Iran was at that time ruled by the Shah and was favourably disposed towards the U.S. But so were a few other countries like Jordan that had strong military ties with Pakistan at that time.

The 1971 war: When Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger failed to 'scare off' the Indians During the 1971 war, US president Richard Nixon and his Assistant for National Security Affairs, Henry Kissinger, spent long hours discussing how they could âscare off the Indiansâ by encouraging China to threaten India Advertisement Fifty years ago, with Indiaâs assistance, Bangladesh freed itself from Pakistani rule. The people of Bangladesh took up arms to fight for their independence when the Pakistani military junta launched a reign of terror on 25 March 1971, in what was then East Pakistan, massacring unarmed civilians and driving ten million Bangladeshis into India. Inevitably, India was drawn into the conflict. War broke out on 3 December and the liberation struggle came to a victorious conclusion on 16 December 1971. On that historic day, the Pakistani armed forces in Bangladesh surrendered unconditionally to the Indian and Bangladeshi forces and Indira Gandhi announced in the Indian Parliament, to deafening applause, that âDhaka is now the free capital of a free countryâ. During the 1971 war, US president Richard Nixon and his Assistant for National Security Affairs, Henry Kissinger, spent long hours discussing how they could âscare off the Indiansâ by encouraging China to threaten India. The Presidentâs reactions reflected his dislike of Indians and his antipathy to Indiaâs prime minister, Indira Gandhi. A US diplomat recollects that Nixon customarily referred to Mrs Gandhi as âthat b***hâ and, when her actions ran counter to the Presidentâs wishes, that sobriquet was âreplaced by more unprintable epithetsâ. Moreover, the Bangladesh liberation war coincided with a dramatic breakthrough in US-China relations. Given the close ties between China and Pakistan, Nixon believed that a pro-Pakistan policy would help forge a new entente with Beijing.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2021-12-10\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d6\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_war_of_1971\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Indo-Pakistani war of 1971 - Wikipedia There was also a meeting between Prime Minister Gandhi and President Nixon in November 1971, where she rejected the US advice against intervening in the ...

Consumed by the war in Vietnam, President Lyndon B. Johnson announced on March 31 that he would not seek re-election. On June 5, immediately after winning the California primaries, former attorney general and then-U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy (brother of the late president John F. Kennedy) was assassinated in Los Angeles. The campaign of Vice President Hubert Humphrey, the Democratic nominee for president, went into a tailspin after the Democratic national convention in Chicago was marred by mass protests and violence. By contrast, Nixon appeared to represent a calmer society, and his campaign promised peace at home and abroad. Despite a late surge by Humphrey, Nixon won by nearly 500,000 popular votes. Third-party candidate George Wallace, the once and future governor of Alabama, won nearly ten million popular votes and 46 electoral votes, principally in the Deep South. First Term Once in office, Nixon and his staff faced the problem of how to end the Vietnam War, which had broken his predecessor's administration and threatened to cause major unrest at home. As protesters in America's cities called for an immediate withdrawal from Southeast Asia, Nixon made a nationally televised address on November 3, 1969, calling on the \\\"silent majority\\\" of Americans to renew their confidence in the American government and back his policy of seeking a negotiated peace in Vietnam. Earlier that year, Nixon and his Defense Secretary Melvin Laird had unveiled the policy of \\\"Vietnamization,\\\" which entailed reducing American troop levels in Vietnam and transferring the burden of fighting to South Vietnam; accordingly, U.S. troop strength in Vietnam fell from 543,000 in April 1969 to zero on March 29, 1973. Nevertheless, the Nixon administration was harshly criticized for its use of American military force in Cambodia and its stepped-up bombing raids during the later years of the first term.

The US Department of State and the Russian Foreign Ministry jointly compiled, translated, annotated, and published nearly the entire recordover one thousand pagesin US-Soviet Relations in the Era of Détente, 1969-1972. This unique collection provides an invaluable snapshot into these important meetings between US and Soviet interlocutors, a record that was long shrouded in secrecy.13 Utilizing these new materials, we argue that the Nixon administrations handling of the crisis on the Subcontinent was neither the abject failure as depicted by critics, nor was it the success that Nixon and Kissinger presented in their memoirs. In fact, this article reaches conclusions midway between the administration and its critics. The picture of the White House response to the crisis reveals that although Nixon and Kissinger superimposed a Cold War distortion on a regional situation, they responded logically. The Nixon administration steadily escalated diplomatic signals and the top policymakers sincerely believed that India had launched external aggressionnot Pakistanwith its support for Mukthi Bahini (liberation force) raids into what was then East Pakistan. Several additional themes run through the narrative of this article, many of which were also reflected in US-Soviet backchannel communications and in the taped conversations. Not surprisingly, Nixon and Kissingers policy perceptions were clearly colored by their personal experiences with Indira Gandhi and Yahya Khan. The White House was unwilling to dismiss Yahyas role as an honest broker in Sino-American rapprochement and likewise saw duplicity on the part of Indira Gandhi after she visited Washington, DC in early November 1971 and claimed that India had no desire for war with Pakistan.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2008-10-10\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d9\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/educational-resources/president-richard-m-nixon-and-gerald-ford-on-antiwar-demonstrations\",\n    \"snippet\": \"President Richard M.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only.

Beyond the Sea depicts Darin's rise to success in both the music and film industry during the 1950s and 1960s as well as his marriage to Sandra Dee, portrayed by Kate Bosworth. As early as 1986, Barry Levinson intended to direct a film based on the life of Darin, and he began pre-production on the project in early 1997. When he eventually vacated the director's position, Spacey, along with Darin's son Dodd, acquired the film rights. Filming for Beyond the Sea took place from November 2003 to January 2004. It was released in December 2004 to mixed reviews from critics and bombed at the box office. Dodd Darin, Sandra Dee and former Darin manager Steve Blauner responded with enthusiastic feedback to Spacey's work on the film. Despite a number of negative reviews, some critics praised Spacey's performance, largely because of his decision to use his own singing voice. He received a Golden Globe nomination. Plot Rather than providing a straightforward biography, the film weaves fantasy sequences with scenes containing somewhat fictionalized accounts of events in Darin's life, and throughout it, the adult singer interacts with his younger self. It chronicles his determination to rise from his working-class roots as Walden Robert Cassotto, a frail boy from The Bronx plagued by multiple bouts of rheumatic fever, who becomes a singer more famous than Frank Sinatra. To achieve that goal, he forms a band and struggles to find gigs at any nightclub that will hire him. As success takes him on the road and away from home, Dee begins to drink heavily, and the couple fights frequently. Eventually, they separate and later reconcile. She gives birth to a son, Dodd. To his actress wife's chagrin, Darin is nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as a shell shocked soldier in Captain Newman, M.D. In the late 1960s, Darin becomes involved in the campaign to elect Robert F. Kennedy for President and contemplates a political career of his own.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2025-03-11\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Sea-Various-Artists/dp/B000641Z9K\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Various Artists - Beyond the Sea - Amazon.com Music Who knew Kevin Spacey could sing?

Track Listings Editorial Reviews Product Description Among only a handful of entertainers who bridged the gap between '50s rock fans and their Sinatra-loving parents, Bronx-born pop legend Bobby Darin's life and career were short but extraordinary. In 1959 the singer/composer rocketed to stardom with 2 Grammy Awards-Best New Artist and Record of the Year for the #1 smash \\\"Mack the Knife.\\\" His other signature smash provides the title for this biopic chronicling his genre-defying music, tempestuous marriage to starlet Sandra Dee, and untimely death at age 37-in 1973-from a heart defect acquired during a childhood illness. Kate Bosworth stars as Dee, and Darin is brought to life by Academy Award winner Kevin Spacey, who also directed the film and sings 18 of the artist's classic hits. Amazon.com You've got to credit Kevin Spacey for sheer gumption: not only did he choose to direct a biopic about Bobby Darin (not the hippest of 1960s singers), but he also decided to star in it despite the fact that he was in his midforties and Darin died at 37. As if this weren't enough, unlike Jamie Foxx in Ray, Spacey performs all the songs himself. The hard-driving \\\"Hello Young Lovers\\\" starts off the album with a bang, the actor working with the big band with casual ease. While Darin is now best known for his swinging \\\"Mack the Knife\\\" and his adaptation of Charles Trenet's \\\"La Mer\\\" (\\\"Beyond the Sea\\\"), he also explored folk and scored with the teeny-bopperish \\\"Splish Splash.\\\" Spacey acquits himself honorably in all these genres, though he's best when he swings hard--his yelpy \\\"Splish Splash\\\" lacks the required levity. No matter what you think of the film itself, what we hear on this album is an actor who wouldn't be out of place in a Broadway musical.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2004-11-28\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d5\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5erwrc/kevin_spacey_sings_beyond_the_sea/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Kevin Spacey Sings - \\\"Beyond the Sea\\\" : r/movies - Reddit TIL In support of the movie \\\"Beyond the Sea,\\\" Kevin Spacey toured and performed Bobby Darin songs. r/todayilearned - TIL In support of the movie ...\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2016-11-25\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d6\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.last.fm/music/Bobby+Darin/_/Beyond+the+Sea/+wiki\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Wiki - Beyond the Sea — Bobby Darin | Last.fm Kevin Spacey sang the song in the movie Beyond the Sea, a biopic about Bobby Darin, in a \\\"fantasy\\\" sequence leading up to his marriage to Sandra Dee.

Trenet had composed \\\"La Mer\\\" (which means \\\"The Sea\\\") with French lyrics totally different and unrelated to the English language version that Lawrence composed. Trenet's French version was an homage and ode to the changing moods of the sea, while Lawrence, by just adding one word \\\"Beyond\\\" to the title, gave him the start whereby he made the song into one of a lover pining for a lost love. It has been recorded by many artists, including Benny Goodman, Mantovani, Roger Williams and Gisele MacKenzie, but Bobby Darin's version released in 1959 is the best known by many, reaching #6 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song reached the top 40 twice prior to the Darin version (Goodman-1948, Williams-1955). Performances by Darin Darin's recording has been used in many films, TV shows and video games, including Apollo 13, Austin Powers in Goldmember, Diner, Goodfellas, Lost, Black Rain, The X-Files, The Adventures of Ford Fairlaine and BioShock. The song was also played in a 2005 commercial for Carnival Cruise Lines. A portion of Bobby Darin's recording was played during the splashdown and post-recovery of Alan Shepard's Freedom 7 in the first episode of the 1998 HBO miniseries, From the Earth to the Moon.

Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

When did they switch over to traveling by car? Some great car history, for travel buffs. “You know, horses are smarter than people. You never heard of a horse going broke betting on people.” –Will Rogers We know from old movies that once upon a time, people traveled by horse. When did people switch from horses to cars? How were they persuaded to make that switch? It all happened in a single decade, beginning in 1907. That’s when the car began to come into its own, replacing the horse and the bicycle as a means for transporting people and goods, across the United States. At that time, there were just 140,300 registered cars and only 2,900 trucks in America. They’d Stopped Riding Horses People still traveled by railroad for long distances, and by foot or horse-drawn carriage for shorter distances. Goods were transported in much the same way. But by this time in history, just about no one rode horses. Lots of people, however, rode bicycles for fun and for carrying things from place to place. By 1917, just ten years later, the number of registered cars had increased 33 fold, to nearly 5 million, with a 134-fold increase in other vehicles (commercial, agricultural, and military) so that they now numbered close to 400,000. It had become downright dangerous for horses to be out on the road. Cars now ruled. Even bicycles had declined in popularity within the United States. The Fresno scraper is this earth-moving equipment that was powered by horses. Here it can be seen in action at the Miocene ditch.

By 1906, steam car development had advanced, and they were among the fastest road vehicles in that period.[citation needed] Throughout this era, the development of automotive technology was rapid, partly due to hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world's attention. Key developments included the electric ignition system, independent suspension, and four-wheel brakes.[15]: 27 [51]: 61 Leaf springs were widely used for suspension, though many other systems were still in use, with angle steel taking over from armored wood as the frame material of choice. Transmissions and throttle controls were widely adopted, allowing a variety of cruising speeds. However, vehicles generally still had discrete speed settings, rather than the infinitely variable system familiar in cars of later eras.

Many Easton’s wealthiest farmers continued to prefer their elegant carriages to the noisy new automobile. Pictured here with his custom built carriage is Sylvanus Mallett, owner of the Sweetbriar farm on Sport Hill Road. Both towns were dominated by agriculture – hardly a lucrative venture. The average farmer couldn’t have afforded to purchase a newfangled horseless carriage even if he had wanted to. And quite frankly, most had not the desire to own something so limited in its capabilities. And neither did some of the more wealthy industrialists who had summer residences in Easton and Redding. One of the directors of Standard Oil – a company that by 1910 was making millions of dollars refining oil and making gasoline – Frederick Sturges, who lived on Burr Street detested automobiles, “The only time I ride in a car is in a taxicab in New York, and then I take my heart in my hand every time I do it.” Hardly a ringing endorsement for the product that used all that gasoline his company was refining. Not all Easton residents were interested in transitioning from the horse and buggy to the automobile. 1909 photo taken just before the Sport Hill Races that year. Automobiles were fair-weather, summer and autumn only vehicles. Early canvas tops were more for keeping the sun off the occupants of an automobile than keeping the rain out. Many cars of the day weren’t even available with side curtains. Cabin heaters didn’t exist. A man or woman operating a horse drawn sleigh could have kept themselves wrapped up in a heavy blanket – they needed only to have their arms and hands free to hold the reins that guided the horse.

By now, horses were far less commonly used as a transport ... When did cars replace horses? For much of human history, horses offered the fastest and most reliable way of travelling long distances or carrying out difficult tasks more easily. Horses were used for work, transport, war and many other purposes. Yet, these days most of those tasks are now carried out by cars or other motorised vehicles. The history of Horses and Humans Humans domesticated the horse about 6,000 years ago. This led to us being able to use the power and durability of these animals to allow society to progress. People could now travel longer distances and to carry out tasks such as farming more easily. From their beginning in the Eurasian steppes, horses spread out over the planet. The European explorers and settlers took them to lands like America, where horses quickly adapted and became a huge part of life for natives and settlers alike. The switch to Motorised Vehicles The Industrial Revolution showed us that machines were the future. Yet, horses remained in place as one of our most valuable methods of transportation and brute strength. There are famous pictures of horses being used in battles as late as World War One, where up to eight million of them lost their lives. But by then the end of their use as the most common transport method was near. The switch to cars happened very quickly, with the US leading the way. In a single decade, the American roads went from having just over 140,000 cars (in 1907) to close to five million in 1917. The number of commercial and agricultural vehicles increased at an even greater rate in this period. Another set of figures from the US shows that there were 22 million horses in 1925 but only 18 million five years later, followed by further declines. On the other hand, cars rose from 20 million to over 26 million in the same period. By now, horses were far less commonly used as a transport method in North America. This story tells us how Brooklyn replaced its horse-drawn fire engine with a motorized version in 1922. It was a story that was repeated across the planet, as new technology came into reach for more and more people who had previously relied on equine power.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2021-04-27\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d8\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.si.edu/spotlight/early-cars\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Early Cars: Fact Sheet for Children - Smithsonian Institution In 1900 wealthy people bought cars for pleasure, comfort, and status.

In 1900 wealthy people bought cars for pleasure, comfort, and status. Many doctors bought small, affordable cars because they were more dependable than horses and easier to keep ready. Rural Americans liked cars because they could cover long distances without depending on trains. They carried produce to market, went to stores and movies in town, and even used their cars to plow fields. Families in towns and cities liked cars because they were handy for errands, going to the train station, visiting relatives, going to church, and going on drives in the country. A family’s house with a car in the driveway has been a common sight since about 1910. Young people liked cars because they could go to movies, restaurants, and other fun places instead of staying at home with their parents. Why do so many people use cars? Cars are fast, comfortable, nice looking, and fun to drive. They can go almost anywhere, and they are always ready for use. In many ways, driving is easier than walking, biking, or riding in a train, bus, or airplane. But owning a car is a big responsibility. It takes a lot of money to buy one and keep it running, and drivers must be trained, licensed, and always alert to avoid mistakes and accidents. It takes a lot of space to park cars, and too many cars cause congestion on roads and in parking lots. Some car owners have returned to walking, biking, or riding a train or bus when it’s more practical or convenient. For most Americans, cars are a favorite way to travel, but there will always be a need for other types of transportation.

In 1950 only 329 horse-drawn vehicles were left. Long-time Chicagoans remember these as belonging to scavengers who prowled the alleys looking for rags and scrap metal. The change from horse to automobile was not a simple substitution, such as the change from writing business letters on typewriters to writing on computers. The change was more profound—more like the change from letters to email. According to Greene, there were perhaps 100,000 horses and 1.7 million people in Chicago in 1900. This means, in modern terms, that the total biomass of horses and people were roughly equal, as was the amount of food required for both. The only actual count of horses that I have been able to find comes from the Bureau of Streets as reported in the Annual Report of the Department of Public Works. In 1907, they counted 77,147 horses. An immense volume of manure had to be swept up and carted off. Especially after 1900, the flies and smell began to be considered problems. Stables were often wooden firetraps filled with hay, bringing back memories of Mrs. O’Leary. The Humane Society Movement was a response to maltreatment of working horses. The 1877 book Black Beauty was the fictional autobiography of an English city horse. U.S. humane societies republished the book, making it a bestseller. Expense, animal diseases, and drunken teamsters (wagon drivers) swearing in front of children were all problems. On the positive side, sidewalks and good streets were an adaptation to horse-drawn traffic. As is shown in the first photo, streets were much clearer of traffic than in later years.

We find one car truck vs a transport carriage drawn by 8 horses, do not know which transport is really meant: people or freight, or both? Vehicles actually 'on the streets' (driven) vs registered (shift working, horses changed/rested, private luxury cars mostly parked away vs always on the street cabs and other commercial transports… All that with \\\"exact year\\\" when we describe a transition period from 1900–1928 means we will see different years for different modalities that are not overly lending themselves for direct comparison.

Other accounts note that in major cities such as New York, London, and Paris, cars outnumbered horses as early as 1912, while in parts of Europe the shift occurred between 1925 and 1930 [d10].

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON. The rest is plain text.\n- ≥80% of final-answer sentences include [dX] (unless abstaining).\n- Use an EM DASH \" — \" in the label line (not hyphen or en dash).\n- Be precise and faithful; no new facts; respect length budgets.\n\nInputs:\n\n- query:\n{query}\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n{retrieved_docs}\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n{per_doc_notes}\n\nTask:\n1) Follow the full OUTPUT CONTRACT exactly.\n   • <think> block with:\n       (A) VALID JSON array for EVERY doc d1…dN (order-preserving, one object per doc; if verdict==\"irrelevant\" set key_fact=\"\")\n       (B) Conflict reasoning FIRST: cluster docs, reference doc IDs, and NAME the mechanism (temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive)\n       (C) ONE label line: \"<ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\"\n       (D) Brief reasoning connecting evidence to the final answer (or abstention)\n   • ONE blank line\n   • Final answer (or exactly \"CANNOT ANSWER, INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\" if abstaining)\n   • Final sentinel line [[END-OF-ANSWER]].\n\nReminders (DO NOT PRINT):\n- Reason FIRST for the conflict: write the analysis in (B), THEN emit the label line in (C); the label must be a direct consequence of the reasoning.\n- Conflict taxonomy (strict): No conflict / Complementary information / Conflicting opinions or research outcomes / Conflict due to outdated information / Conflict due to misinformation.\n- Use only existing doc_ids in bracketed citations [dX]; no ranges like d1–d5; never cite out-of-bounds [dK].\n- Prefer high-credibility sources and order citations high→low in the evidence list.\n- If any doc is \"supports\" or \"partially supports\", DO NOT abstain.\n- Close </think> before the answer; no extra text outside the required format."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Inputs:\n\n- query:\nwhat to see in chicago downtown?\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.choosechicago.com/articles/itineraries/24-hours-in-downtown-chicago/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"24 Hours in Downtown Chicago Itinerary 24 hours in downtown Chicago ; Stop 1: Visit Art Institute of Chicago ; Stop 2: See “The Bean” at Millennium Park ; Stop 3: Wander the Chicago Cultural Center Check out the to-scale skyscraper models in the Skyscraper Gallery and the approximately 4,200-piece immersive City of Chicago model on the main level, before picking the perfect architectural walking, bus, or boat tour at the center’s box office.

Chicago is so much more than its downtown core, but with just 36 hours in the city, I decided it was wise to spend our time all in one place (commuting around to different neighborhoods soaks up valuable travel time, after all!). Today I’m sharing my guide to the best things to see and do (and eat!) in The Loop, West Loop, and River North – or the areas most would consider downtown. But before we jump into the guide, here are five fun facts to get you acquainted with the city quickly: Five Things You May Not Know About Chicago The famed American roadway Route 66 begins in Chicago (unless you’re starting on the other end, in L.A.!) – you can find the route marker near the main entrance to the Art Institute of Chicago. The Chicago River is the only river in the world that has been reversed to run backward. Instead of running toward Lake Michigan, it now runs away from it. The Centennial Wheel at Navy Pier is now an iconic part of the Chicago skyline, but its importance to the city runs deeper than just sheer thrills. When Chicago hosted the World’s Fair in 1893, the Ferris wheel was the centerpiece of the exhibition – and the very first one. Commercial rent for properties along The Magnificent Mile (a 13-block portion of Michigan Avenue with hundreds of luxury retailers) is currently the third-highest in the nation – after Fifth Avenue in NYC and Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. Now, let’s go visit! THINGS TO DO IN CHICAGO Arts, culture, sports - Chicago has it all. With such a short time in the city, it's best to find a unique way to get acquainted with the city's layout and to check out its finest possessions.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

A 2008 study had habitual coffee drinkers with type 2 diabetes continuously monitor their blood sugar while doing daily activities. During the day, it was shown that right after they drank coffee, their blood sugar would soar. Blood sugar was higher on days that they drank coffee than it was on days they didn’t. If you don’t have diabetes but are concerned about developing it, be careful before increasing your coffee intake. There may be a positive effect from coffee in its pure form. However, the benefits aren’t the same for coffee drinks with added sweeteners or dairy products. Daily diabetes tip Coffee may be more popular than ever, but drinking it on a regular basis isn’t the best way to manage diabetes — even if (believe it or not) there’s growing evidence that it could help prevent diabetes. Was this helpful? Creamy, sugary drinks found at cafe chains are often loaded with unhealthy carbs. They’re also very high in calories. The impact of the sugar and fat in a lot of coffee and espresso drinks can outweigh the good from any protective effects of the coffee. The same can be said about sugar-sweetened and even artificially sweetened coffee and other beverages. Once sweetener is added, it increases your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Consuming too many added sugars is directly linked to diabetes and obesity. Having coffee drinks that are high in saturated fat or sugar on a regular basis can add to insulin resistance. It can eventually contribute to type 2 diabetes. No food or supplement offers total protection against type 2 diabetes. If you have prediabetes or are at risk for getting diabetes, losing weight, exercising, and consuming a balanced, nutrient-dense diet is the best way to reduce your risk. Taking up drinking coffee in order to stave off diabetes won’t guarantee you a good result.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/coffee/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Coffee | The Nutrition Source | Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public ... Evidence from the American Institute for Cancer Research concludes that drinking coffee may reduce risk for endometrial and liver cancer, and based on a systematic review of a large body of research, it is not a risk for the cancers that were studied. In June 2018, the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) proposed a new regulation exempting coffee from displaying cancer warnings under Proposition 65. This proposal was based on a review of more than 1,000 studies published by the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer that found inadequate evidence that drinking coffee causes cancer. In January 2019, OEHHA completed its review and response to comments and submitted the regulation to the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) for final review. Type 2 Diabetes Although ingestion of caffeine can increase blood sugar in the short-term, long-term studies have shown that habitual coffee drinkers have a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with non-drinkers. The polyphenols and minerals such as magnesium in coffee may improve the effectiveness of insulin and glucose metabolism in the body. In a meta-analysis of 45,335 people with type 2 diabetes followed for up to 20 years, an association was found with increasing cups of coffee and a lower risk of developing diabetes. Compared with no coffee, the decreased risk ranged from 8% with 1 cup a day to 33% for 6 cups a day. Caffeinated coffee showed a slightly greater benefit than decaffeinated coffee. [7] Another meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies showed similar associations. When comparing the highest intake of coffee (up to 10 cups a day) with the lowest (<1 cup), there was a 30% decreased risk of type 2 diabetes in those drinking the highest amounts of coffee and caffeine and a 20% decreased risk when drinking decaffeinated coffee.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.diabetes.co.uk/food/coffee-and-diabetes.html\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Coffee and Diabetes - Benefits of Coffee & Effect on Blood Sugar Coffee and Diabetes The effect of coffee on diabetes, when presented in the media can often be confusing. News stories can in the same week tout the benefits coffee can have on diabetes and shoot down coffee as being unhelpful for blood sugar levels. This doesn’t mean the articles are contradictory though. Put slightly more simply, coffee contains different chemicals, some of which have beneficial effects whereas others can have a less beneficial effect, such as caffeine which can impair insulin in the short term. Caffeine and blood sugar levels Whilst the researchers found a relationship between higher coffee consumption and lower sensitivity to insulin, they recognised that the rapid transition to having more coffee may have produced an atypical or emphasised response by the body. Coffee contains polyphenols, which are a molecule that anti-oxidant properties which are widely believed to help prevent inflammatory illnesses, such as type 2 diabetes, and anticarcinogenic (anti-cancer) properties. As well as polyphenols, coffee contains the mineral magnesium and chromium. Greater magnesium intake has been linked with lower rates of type 2 diabetes. The blend of these nutrients can be helpful for improving insulin sensitivity, which may help to offset the opposite effects of caffeine. Coffee and prevention of diabetes Coffee and its effect on risks of developing type 2 diabetes have been studied a number of times and has indicated a notably lower risk of type 2 diabetes being associated with coffee drinkers. Decaffeinated coffee and blood glucose So whilst caffeine may hamper insulin sensitivity, other properties in coffee have the opposite effect. It is therefore believed that decaffeinated coffee may present the best option for people with diabetes as researchers find it includes the benefits of coffee with some of negative effects that are associated with caffeine.

There is mounting evidence that sugary drinks contribute to chronic inflammation, high triglycerides, decreased “good” (HDL) cholesterol, and increased insulin resistance, all of which are risk factors for diabetes. [19] What to drink in place of the sugary stuff? Water is an excellent choice. Coffee and tea are also good calorie-free substitutes for sugared beverages (as long as you don’t load them up with sugar and cream). And there’s convincing evidence that coffee may help protect against diabetes; [20,21] emerging research suggests that tea may hold diabetes-prevention benefits as well, but more research is needed. There’s been some controversy over whether artificially sweetened beverages are beneficial for weight control and, by extension, diabetes prevention. [22] Some studies have found that people who regularly drink diet beverages have a higher risk of diabetes than people who rarely drink such beverages, [23,24] but there could be another explanation for those findings. People often start drinking diet beverages because they have a weight problem or a family history of diabetes; studies that don’t adequately account for these other factors may make it wrongly appear as though the diet soda led to the increased diabetes risk. A long-term analysis on data from 40,000 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study found that drinking one 12-ounce serving of diet soda a day did not appear to increase diabetes risk. [25] So, in moderation diet beverages can be a sugary-drink alternative for adults. 3. Choose healthy fats. The types of fats in your diet can also affect the development of diabetes. Healthful fats, such as the polyunsaturated fats found in liquid vegetable oils, nuts, and seeds can help ward off type 2 diabetes. [26] Trans fats do just the opposite.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d5\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.rush.edu/news/health-benefits-coffee\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Health Benefits of Coffee | RUSH 7% less likely to die early from any cause, 19% less likely to die of heart disease and 18% less likely to develop cancer than those who don't drink coffee. 2. Protect against Type 2 diabetes. A 2014 study by Harvard researchers published in the journal Diabetologica tracked nearly 124,000 people for 16 to 20 years. Those who increased their coffee intake by more than a cup a day over a four-year period had an 11% lower risk of developing Type 2 diabetes; those who decreased their intake by one cup per day had a 17% higher risk of developing the disease. The reason may be the antioxidants in coffee, which reduce inflammation (inflammation contributes to your Type 2 diabetes risk). If you already have Type 2 diabetes, however, you should avoid caffeinated products, including coffee. Caffeine has been shown to raise both blood sugar and insulin levels in people with the disease. 3. Control Parkinson's disease symptoms. A number of studies have suggested that consuming caffeine can reduce your risk of developing Parkinson's disease — and research published in 2012 in the journal of the American Academy of Neurology showed that a daily dose of caffeine equivalent to that found in two eight-ounce cups of black coffee can help to control the involuntary movements of people who already have the disease. (You'd have to drink nearly eight cups of brewed black tea to get the same amount of caffeine.) 4. Slow the progress of dementia. In a 2012 study published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, Florida researchers tested the blood levels of caffeine in older adults with mild cognitive impairments, which can be a precursor to severe dementia, including Alzheimer's disease.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d6\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/04/150430191138.htm\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Replacing one serving of sugary drink per day by water or ... Replacing one serving of sugary drink per day by water or unsweetened tea or coffee cuts risk of type 2 diabetes, study shows Date: April 30, 2015 Source: Diabetologia Summary: Replacing the daily consumption of one serving of a sugary drink with either water or unsweetened tea or coffee can lower the risk of developing diabetes by between 14 percent and 25 percent, concludes new research. New research published in Diabetologia (the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes) indicates that for each 5% increase of a person's total energy intake provided by sweet drinks including soft drinks, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes may increase by 18%. However, the study also estimates that replacing the daily consumption of one serving of a sugary drink with either water or unsweetened tea or coffee can lower the risk of developing diabetes by between 14% and 25%. This research is based on the large EPIC-Norfolk study which included more than 25,000 men and women aged 40-79 years living in Norfolk, UK. Study participants recorded everything that they ate and drank for 7 consecutive days covering weekdays and weekend days, with particular attention to type, amount and frequency of consumption, and whether sugar was added by the participants. During approximately 11 years of follow-up, 847 study participants were diagnosed with new-onset type 2 diabetes. Lead scientist Dr Nita Forouhi, of the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge, said: \\\"By using this detailed dietary assessment with a food diary, we were able to study several different types of sugary beverages, including sugar-sweetened soft drinks, sweetened tea or coffee and sweetened milk drinks as well as artificially sweetened beverages (ASB) and fruit juice, and to examine what would happen if water, unsweetened tea or coffee or ASB were substituted for sugary drinks.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d7\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.diabetes.org.uk/diabetes-the-basics/types-of-diabetes/type-2/preventing/ten-tips-for-healthy-eating\",\n    \"snippet\": \"10 tips for healthy eating | Type 2 diabetes risk | Diabetes UK Breadcrumb Savefor later Page saved!

There are some things that you can change and some you can’t. Our tips on healthy eating could help reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Things like your age, ethnicity and family history can all contribute to your overall risk. We also know that having obesity is the most significant risk factor. If you know you have obesity, losing weight is one way you can prevent type 2 diabetes. And eating a healthy, balanced diet is way great way to manage your weight. Any amount of weight loss can help, research shows losing even 1kg can help to reduce your risk. There are so many different ways to lose weight, so it’s important to find out what works best for you. We know that not everyone who is at risk or living with diabetes type 2 diabetes is carrying extra weight. But whether you need to lose weight or not, it is still important to make healthier food choices. Research tells us that there are even certain foods that are linked to reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes. Here are our top tips for healthier food choices you can make, to reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes. 1. Choose drinks without added sugar We know there is a link between having full sugar fizzy and energy drinks, and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Cutting down on these can help to reduce your risk and support keeping your weight down. Evidence also shows that drinking unsweetened tea and coffee is associated with a reduced risk. If you are finding it hard to cut down, look out for diet or low calorie versions of soft drinks and check there’s no added sugar. Try not to replace sugary drinks with fruit juices or smoothies as these still contain a high amount of free sugar. Try plain water, plain milk, tea or coffee without added sugar, as replacements.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  }\n]\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"verdict\": \"partially supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"The snippet notes growing evidence that coffee could help prevent diabetes but warns that drinking coffee regularly is not a guaranteed way to avoid type 2 diabetes.\",\n    \"quote\": \"Coffee may be more popular than ever, but drinking it on a regular basis isn’t the best way to manage diabetes — even if (believe it or not) there’s growing evidence that it could help prevent diabetes.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"It mentions possible preventive effects but emphasizes uncertainty and lack of guarantee, making the evidence incomplete.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"low\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"Long-term studies show habitual coffee drinkers have a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with non-drinkers.\",\n    \"quote\": \"long-term studies have shown that habitual coffee drinkers have a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with non-drinkers.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The snippet directly states that long-term coffee drinking lowers the risk of type 2 diabetes, fully answering the query.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"high\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"verdict\": \"partially supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"Studies have indicated a notably lower risk of type 2 diabetes among coffee drinkers, but the evidence is mixed due to both beneficial and less beneficial effects of coffee components.\",\n    \"quote\": \"Coffee and its effect on risks of developing type 2 diabetes have been studied a number of times and has indicated a notably lower risk of type 2 diabetes being associated with coffee drinkers.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The snippet links coffee drinking with lower diabetes risk but presents mixed effects, so it provides relevant yet incomplete evidence.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"low\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"The snippet states there is convincing evidence that coffee may help protect against diabetes.\",\n    \"quote\": \"And there’s convincing evidence that coffee may help protect against diabetes;\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"It directly claims convincing evidence that coffee helps protect against diabetes, answering the query affirmatively.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"high\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d5\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"A 2014 Harvard study found that increasing coffee intake by more than one cup a day lowered the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by 11%.\",\n    \"quote\": \"Those who increased their coffee intake by more than a cup a day over a four-year period had an 11% lower risk of developing Type 2 diabetes;\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The snippet directly states that higher coffee consumption reduces the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, answering the query affirmatively.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"high\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d6\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"Replacing one serving of a sugary drink per day with unsweetened coffee can lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 14% to 25%.\",\n    \"quote\": \"Replacing the daily consumption of one serving of a sugary drink with either water or unsweetened tea or coffee can lower the risk of developing diabetes by between 14 percent and 25 percent, concludes new research.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The snippet explicitly states that substituting sugary drinks with unsweetened coffee reduces type 2 diabetes risk, directly answering the query.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"low\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d7\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"Evidence shows that drinking unsweetened tea and coffee is associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes.\",\n    \"quote\": \"Evidence also shows that drinking unsweetened tea and coffee is associated with a reduced risk.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The snippet explicitly states that drinking unsweetened coffee is linked to a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, directly answering the query.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"high\"\n  }\n]\n\nTask:\n1) Follow the full OUTPUT CONTRACT exactly.\n   • <think> block with:\n       (A) VALID JSON array for EVERY doc d1…dN (order-preserving, one object per doc;

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide.

Symptoms of the Black Plague Europeans were scarcely equipped for the horrible reality of the Black Death. “In men and women alike,” the Italian poet Giovanni Boccaccio wrote, “at the beginning of the malady, certain swellings, either on the groin or under the armpits…waxed to the bigness of a common apple, others to the size of an egg, some more and some less, and these the vulgar named plague-boils.” Blood and pus seeped out of these strange swellings, which were followed by a host of other unpleasant symptoms—fever, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, terrible aches and pains—and then, in short order, death. The Bubonic Plague attacks the lymphatic system, causing swelling in the lymph nodes. If untreated, the infection can spread to the blood or lungs. How Did the Black Death Spread? The Black Death was terrifyingly, indiscriminately contagious: “the mere touching of the clothes,” wrote Boccaccio, “appeared to itself to communicate the malady to the toucher.” The disease was also terrifyingly efficient. People who were perfectly healthy when they went to bed at night could be dead by morning. Did you know? Many scholars think that the nursery rhyme “Ring around the Rosy” was written about the symptoms of the Black Death. Understanding the Black Death Today, scientists understand that the Black Death, now known as the plague, is spread by a bacillus called Yersinia pestis. (The French biologist Alexandre Yersin discovered this germ at the end of the 19th century.) They know that the bacillus travels from person to person through the air, as well as through the bite of infected fleas and rats.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/the-plague\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Plague (Black Death) bacterial infection information and facts Stages of plague 4:01 Plague 101 What is plague? How many people died from the Black Death and the other plague pandemics? Learn about the bacterium behind the plague disease, how factors like trade and urbanization caused it to spread to every continent except Antarctica, and how three devastating pandemics helped shape modern medicine. For hundreds of years, what caused plague outbreaks remained mysterious, and shrouded in superstitions. But keen observations and advances in microscopes eventually helped unveil the true culprit. In 1894, Alexandre Yersin discovered the bacterium responsible for causing plague: Yersinia pestis. Y. pestis is an extraordinarily virulent, rod-shaped bacterium. Y. pestis disables the immune system of its host by injecting toxins into defense cells, such as macrophages, that are tasked with detecting bacterial infections. Once these cells are knocked out, the bacteria can multiply unhindered. Many small mammals act as hosts to the bacteria, including rats, mice, chipmunks, prairie dogs, rabbits, and squirrels. During an enzootic cycle, Y. pestis can circulate at low rates within populations of rodents, mostly undetected because it doesn’t produce an outbreak. When the bacteria pass to other species, during an epizootic cycle, humans face a greater risk for becoming infected with plague bacteria. Rats have long been thought to be the main vector of plague outbreaks, because of their intimate connection with humans in urban areas. Scientists have more recently discovered that a flea that lives on rats, Xenopsylla cheopis,primarily causes human cases of plague. When rodents die from the plague, fleas jump to a new host, biting them and transmitting Y. pestis. Transmission also occurs by handling tissue or blood from a plague-infected animal, or inhalation of infected droplets.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2015/feb/24/dirty-rat-giant-gerbils-responsible-black-death\",\n    \"snippet\": \"You dirty rat!

The flea is parasitic on house and field rats and seeks out other prey when its rodent host dies. Rats were an amplifying factor to bubonic plague due to their common association with humans as well as the nature of their blood.[15] The rat's blood allows the rat to withstand a major concentration of the plague.[15] The bacteria form aggregates in the gut of infected fleas, and this results in the flea regurgitating ingested blood, which is now infected, into the bite site of a rodent or human host. Once established, the bacteria rapidly spread to the lymph nodes of the host and multiply. The fleas that transmit the disease only directly infect humans when the rat population in the area is wiped out from a mass infection.[16] Furthermore, in areas with a large population of rats, the animals can harbor low levels of the plague infection without causing human outbreaks.[15]\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d5\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.snexplores.org/article/dont-blame-rats-spreading-black-death\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Don't blame the rats for spreading the Black Death He is a biologist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins. “It’s nice to see a model that shows [it could happen].” Studying illnesses of the past is important for the future, Antolin notes.

Can we predict the next big outbreak?” Even if rats played a role in the Black Death, they wouldn’t have been the biggest factor, Antolin explains. Instead, environmental conditions that allowed rats, fleas and lice to spend so much time around people would have played a larger role. Until modern times, he notes, people were gross. They didn’t wash often and there were no modern sewers. Not only that, rats and mice could thrive in the straw that many people used in their buildings for roofing and a floor covering.

It wasn't me Latest News from BPCA Black Death? It wasn’t me A new study suggests that rats might not be responsible for spreading the Black Death and subsequent epidemics of bubonic plague that rampaged across Europe, Asia and Africa for over 600 years. For many people, the first thoughts about pest control came from a primary school history lesson where you learned about the Black Death. Your teacher may have told you how an estimated third of Europe's population (25 million people) was wiped out between 1347 and 1351 because rats spread fleas, which in turn spread bubonic plague. A particularly good teacher may have even told you that’s why we keep rats away from people – so we stop the spread of deadly diseases and learn the lessons history taught us. The general public is generally pretty ignorant about our sector – but most people will tell you: rats equal plague. A new study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science suggests, while people commonly assume that rats and their fleas spread the plague, “human ectoparasites, like body lice and human fleas, might be more likely than rats to have caused the rapidly developing epidemics in pre-industrial Europe”. In other words, humans spread the plague. A win for the rattus rattus PR team if ever there was one. In modern instances of plague, such as the outbreak in Madagascar in 2017, rats and other rodents helped spread the disease. If Y. pestis bacterium infects rats, they can pass it to their fleas as they drink the rodents’ blood. When a plague-infected rat dies, its parasites abandon the corpse and can go on to bite humans – often with the help of domestic animals. This was thought to be how medieval plagues spread. However, the new study presents an alternative argument.

They have generally poor eyesight but their sense of smell, taste, touch and hearing are all excellent. I know history paints Greensboro rats as pretty nasty creatures as they were credited with spreading the bubonic plague, usually called the Black Death in the history books. The rats did not spread bubonic plague, the fleas the North Carolina rats carried into human dwellings spread bubonic plague, so even if the rats did bring them in they were not directly responsible for spreading the plague. One disease that is linked with rats and they are responsible for helping its spread is foot and mouth disease. As far back as the late 19th century people started breeding brown Greensboro rats as pets, these rats depending on how many generations they've been bred as pets now behave absolutely nothing like their wild counterparts and they also pose no more of a health risk than a cat or a dog.

Are rats a danger to humans? Yes. Rats are a serious hazard to public health. Aside from contaminating food with their droppings and urine, fleas from rats were responsible for spreading the bubonic plague. Today, such diseases as salmonella bacteria (food poisoning), leptospira (jaundice), and typhus are commonly spread by rats. Because of their unsanitary habits, secondary infections from rat bites can be serious and sometimes fatal. An infestation of rats must not be tolerated. When are rats most common? Rats are year-round pests. Under certain conditions, rats can survive outdoors during the winter. However activity and indoor migration increases as weather gets cooler and outdoor food and water sources decrease. When am I most likely to see rats? Rats are most active during the evening and remain so until the middle of the night. If food and water are scarce, or in the case of large infestations, rats become active during daylight hours. Where do rats build nests? Rats nest in any safe location near food and water. Outdoors, rats burrow into the ground. Indoors, nesting occurs in double walls, between ceilings and floors, in closed-in areas around worktops and anywhere rubbish is allowed to accumulate. What are their breeding habits? The average lifespan of a rat is 18 months. Young rats are born about 22 days after mating and will mature rapidly. Single females may have as many as 6 litters a year, averaging 6 to 14 young each. By 3 months of age, the young are independent and capable of reproduction. If not controlled, an infestation of rats will rapidly increase in numbers.

While it’s highly unlikely roof rats here in suburban Phoenix have come into contact with plague—cases of which do happen here in Arizona in wilderness areas—they can carry several other serious diseases. This can include typhus, jaundice, salmonellosis, and rat-bite fever. These diseases can be spread to humans through exposure to droppings, urine, carried fleas, or—as you may have inferred—bites. If you do come into contact with a roof rat or its nest, leave it alone and instead call in one of our rodent professionals. Only a pest professional, wearing proper protective clothing, should clean out or deal with a rodent colony. Preventing a roof rat infestation Like all pests, roof rats need regular access to shelter, food, and water. If denied these things, they’ll typically move on from your home to an easier target. Homeowners who take proactive steps to keep their yard clean, pick up food waste, and seal off entry points are typically less likely to have a roof rat infestation. Denying shelter True to their name, roof rats prefer to build their colonies in attics and roofs, where they are less likely to be disturbed by people and potential predators, such as feral neighborhood cats or barn owls. Once established, this colony can grow quickly. However, these rats are far from picky. They can also create their nests beneath wood piles, in storage boxes, under shrubs, and in garages and storage sheds. An unkempt yard with abandoned vehicles, multiple storage sheds, and overgrown bushes is just about paradise for a rat.

Every year, residents in the city make more complaints to pest control professionals than anywhere else. Roof rats are agile black rats that tend to invade homes by climbing on trees and roofs. In addition to being good at invading homes, these rats have another strike against them. They are notorious for spreading diseases and may be responsible for spreading the Bubonic Plague.

They also carry parasites that spread diseases, which further increases the risk of you getting sick. Secondly, rats cause property damage.

In Madagascar, the main host of plague is the black rat, Rattus rattus[30], that is widespread throughout the island [30], while two species of fleas are involved as vectors [31]: Xenopsylla cheopis, the oriental rat flea, which has a cosmopolitan distribution, and Synopsyllus fonquerniei, an endemic flea from Madagascar whose distribution is restricted to central highlands. Compared to many other natural plague foci, only a few species are involved in the transmission of the disease [3]. Nevertheless, and despite its importance regarding public health, the causes of plague persistence in Madagascar have never been explored. Preliminary population genetic studies suggested that rat populations from the highlands are more geographically structured than those of the coastal areas, probably because of the more rugged physical landscape that limits migration [33]. Also, consistent with the hypothesis of a causal relationship between plague persistence and host resistance, at least 50% of the rats caught in Malagasy highlands are plague-resistant, whereas they are all susceptible in low altitude plague-free areas [34], [35]. However, as highlands were colonised by rats from coastal areas several centuries ago [34], the evolution of plague resistance in Malagasy black rats may be recent and posterior to the spread of the disease. It might thus be a consequence rather than a primary cause of plague persistence in rural areas of central highlands. Building on the model of Keeling & Gilligan [20], [21], we developed a theoretical approach to evaluate independently the roles of host population structure and of host resistance in the long-term persistence of plague.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  }\n]\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"Scientists understand that the plague, or Black Death, is spread by the bacterium Yersinia pestis through the air and via bites from infected fleas and rats.\",\n    \"quote\": \"Today, scientists understand that the Black Death, now known as the plague, is spread by a bacillus called Yersinia pestis. ...

Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

The FIBA Men's World Ranking, are FIBA's rankings of national basketball teams. FIBA ranks both men's and women's national teams for both senior and junior competitions. It also publishes combined rankings for all mixed-sex competitions. Not included are the rankings for three-on-three competitions, which are tabulated for individual players. The ranking system compares teams based on the weighted average rating points they earn in games over the last eight years. Teams earn a certain amount of rating points for each game based on the margin of victory/defeat, site of game and strength of opponent. Each game's rating points are then weighted by factors including the time of game, competition/region, competition stage and round reached. The ranking is currently sponsored by Nike; as such, the names Nike FIBA World Ranking or FIBA World Ranking Men, presented by Nike is also used.[2][3] History In its previous ranking system before October 2017, FIBA used a competition-based system which awarded points based on the final standings of FIBA final tournaments.[4] The system weighted all results within the eight-year period equally and did not consider the results of qualifiers for tournaments.[3][5] Until the 2016 Olympic Games, the Olympics and the men's world championship gave 5 points each toward the ranking. Since the new FIBA ranking system was launched, these two tournaments had their score devalued to 2.5 points for playing in a World championship, and 2 points for playing in an Olympic game since 2017. Calculation Only FIBA tournaments consisting of full five-a-side teams are used in calculations for the rankings. Other tournaments, such as regional championships, invitationals, three-on-three half-court basketball, and friendlies are not included. On October 11, 2017, FIBA radically changed its ranking system for men's national teams when Nike became FIBA's strategic partner. The changes saw the ranking system switching from the previous competition-based system to a game-based system.[5][6]\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://olympics.com/en/news/fiba-men-basketball-world-ranking-complete-list\",\n    \"snippet\": \"FIBA men's basketball world ranking: Complete list - Olympics.com FIBA Men's Basketball World Rankings ahead of 2023 World Cup ; 1.

Racking up a pair of victories against Uruguay and Panama in the FIBA AmeriCup 2025 Qualifiers, Brazil are on the rise and have moved up from 12th place to 11th.

The Top 10 sees USA solidifying their status as the number one ranked nation, followed by second placed Serbia and then Germany. The top five is rounded out by France and Canada. The other climber along with Brazil in the Top 20 is Montenegro, who moved up to 16th place after claiming a pair of wins against Bulgaria. That propels them above Poland who replace them in 17th after splitting their games in the latest FIBA EuroBasket 2025 Qualifiers window. Elsewhere in the rankings, Uruguay can reflect on a significant forward step by moving into the Top 50.

Share this article While we are still a few weeks away from the 2024 Paris Olympics, we now know which 12 teams will actually compete for a chance to win gold. Seven teams, including USA and Canada, qualified for the 2024 Olympics in Paris based on their performance at the 2023 FIBA World Cup. France earned qualification as a host nation, bumping that number up to eight. 24 additional countries competed for the final spots in Olympic competition during four qualifying tournaments. The winners were Spain, Greece, Brazil, and Puerto Rico and all will advance to play during the Olympics. Some of the most notable nations who will not compete in Paris include Latvia, Argentina, Lithuania, Slovenia, Italy, and Poland. 12 South Sudan The biggest underdog to appear in the Olympics is South Sudan, who earned a qualification during the 2023 FIBA World Cup. They saw fantastic games from Carlik Jones (a former NBA guard who played in China last season) and Wenyen Gabriel (who played in the NBA from 2018 until last year) during the tournament. This roster is now deeper after adding Bol Bol, Thon Maker, Makur Maker, and another year of development for Khaman Maluach (a projected lottery pick in the 2025 NBA Draft). 11 Japan fiba.basketball WORLD RANKING: 26 GROUP: B Los Angeles Lakers forward Rui Hachimura is the most recognizable player on the roster for Japan, who earned a spot in the Olympics during the 2023 FIBA World Cup.

Spain has an experienced roster that has shown recent highs (a 2022 Eurobasket title) and lows (finishing ninth at 2023's FIBA World Cup) to require a qualifying tournament win to reach Paris. That makes them the biggest wild card of the Games. The FIBA World Rankings are high on Spain, ranking them second as of late February. A core led by international veterans with NBA experience (Rudy Fernandez) paired with rising international talent (Usman Garuba and Santi Aldama) should do well against Group A competition. A run to the medal round is certainly possible, but the difficulty of their group could see the Spaniards sink to fourth if their inconsistent form returns. 5. Canada The golden generation of Canadian basketball has arrived, as America's neighbors to the north have begun producing NBA talent in spades. A bronze medal at the 2023 FIBA World Cup punched Canada's first Olympic ticket since 2000, and they have all the talent necessary to go on another run to the medal round here as well. MVP candidate Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is the star for Team Canada, which also features versatile weapons like Lu Dort, Jamal Murray, R.J. Barrett, Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Dillon Brooks. While post play may not be a strength for the Canadians, their capability on the wings and ability to put the ball in the basket gives them an excellent chance to finish inside the top two of the rugged Group A. 4. Serbia Nikola Jokic is the headliner on a deep Serbian team that is back in the Olympics for the first time since 2016, when they lost by 30 to the United States in the gold medal game. Serbia is clicking right now after winning a silver medal last year at the FIBA World Cup and takes tremendous pride in their ability to compete against the world's top superpowers on the court.

Team USA tops FIBA men's world rankings, overtaking Spain USA Basketball is back atop the FIBA men's world rankings, even after failing to medal at the World Cup. The Americans flipped spots with Spain for No. 1 in the world in the updated rankings that were released Friday, reclaiming the top spot that they lost late last year. Spain is now No. 2, and World Cup champion Germany soared eight spots to No. 3 on the world list -- the best in that program's history. It's certainly possible now that the Americans will keep the top spot leading into the Paris Olympics, where the U.S. will aim for a fifth consecutive gold medal.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Can Hemophilia Be Cured? Hemophilia is a bleeding disorder that is inherited, or passed down from parent to child. It is characterized by a deficiency of certain proteins known as “clotting factors,” leading to blood that doesn’t clot well and excessive or spontaneous bleeding. Hemophilia may develop after birth in extremely rare cases. A cure for hemophilia has not yet been discovered. However, there are several treatment options available to help individuals with this condition manage their symptoms, prevent complications and live a normal life. Each patient’s best course of treatment will depend on what type of hemophilia is present: Hemophilia A – The most common type, hemophilia A can be treated with desmopressin—a prescription hormone that is injected into a vein to help activate blood clotting factors. Hemophilia B – Also known as Christmas disease, hemophilia B can be treated by infusing blood with clotting factors from a donor or in synthetic form. Hemophilia C – The rarest type, hemophilia C can be treated through plasma infusions that work to stop excessive bleeding following trauma or injury. Self-Care Measures for Hemophilia People with hemophilia can also take self-care measures to help manage their symptoms, prevent bleeding episodes and improve overall health.

Hemophilia is a bleeding disorder which is usually inherited. It results from a genetic mutation or alteration in one of the genes that provide instructions for producing clotting factor proteins essential for forming blood clots. Individuals with hemophilia suffer from spontaneous bleeding as well as excessive bleeding following injury or surgery. The severity of hemophilia is determined by the amount of clotting factor present, with lower levels resulting in a higher likelihood of bleeding and potentially serious health complications. Individuals with a severe form of hemophilia are at high risk of experiencing internal bleeding, particularly in their knees, ankles, and elbows, which can cause damage to organs and tissues and pose a life-threatening risk. Hemophilia can be treated with preventative or on-demand approaches. Most cases of hemophilia are severe and require preventative treatment, which involves regular clotting factor injections to prevent bleeding and joint/muscle damage. Patients receiving preventative treatment require ongoing monitoring and usually continue treatment for life. On-demand treatment is used to treat prolonged bleeding as needed. In the global effort to eradicate hemophilia, innovative treatments based on genetic engineering are emerging. Israel has gained recognition for early detection of hemophilia, and Sheba is breaking new ground in the treatment of the disease. In a groundbreaking study in the fight against hemophilia, Sheba researchers played a pivotal role in replacing the defective gene responsible for the disorder’s severe effects. The experiment, which included 50 medical centers across 30 countries, and was conducted by BioMarin, involved 134 elderly patients who were suffering from hemophilia, including five individuals from Israel. The findings, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, reveal that researchers were able to successfully insert a healthy gene into the liver of the participants using a virus.

There’s currently no cure for hemophilia, but patients can be treated with an intravenous clotting factor. “In hemophilia, patients are missing a single clotting factor protein, either factor VIII or IX, which arrests the progress of the clot formation putting patients at risk for serious bleeding, particularly recurrent bleeding into joints with subsequent development of crippling arthritis,” Dr. Steven Pipe, chair of the Medical and Scientific Advisory Committee of the National Hemophilia Foundation, told Healthline. “To prevent this pathology, they administer ‘replacement therapy’ by infusing the factor VIII or IX proteins on a regular basis – typically every other day for factor VIII and 2 to 3 times per week for factor IX,” Pipe said. Replacement therapies have revolutionized outcomes for those with hemophilia, but the treatment is not without its problems. “When patients born with no expression of factor VIII or IX at birth are exposed to replacement proteins of factor VIII or IX, their immune system can mount a response to what it perceives as a foreign protein,” Pipe said. “These antibodies can inactivate the protein such that it will no longer treat or prevent their bleeding. This happens in up to 30 percent or more of patients with severe hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency). These inhibitors require alternative but less effective treatments and lead to poorer outcomes for patients.” In most individuals with hemophilia, regular treatment from infusions can prevent the vast majority of bleeding. But it comes at a heavy cost for both patients and caregivers. Treatment for infants can begin at 1 year of age or earlier. Parents must learn how to administer treatments that can be as frequent as every second day. “This comes at a tremendous cost to patients, families, and health systems. We know that joint disease can still appear in young adults and annualized bleeding rates are still not zero.

But with safe recombinant clotting factors and with the prospect of gene therapy on the horizon, children born today can expect to live into their 70s or 80s. Unfortunately, there is not yet a cure for hemophilia, though new developments may make a cure possible in the next five to 10 years. Technically, hemophilia can be cured through a liver transplant, but the risks involved in the surgery and the requirement for lifelong medications to prevent rejection of the new liver may outweigh the benefits. Researchers are currently working on a way to insert the factor VIII or factor IX gene into the cells of patients with hemophilia to produce some clotting factor. People treated with this gene therapy should have fewer bleeding episodes. The present goal of gene therapy is to raise factor levels enough to decrease the frequency and severity of bleeding episodes and to prevent the complications of bleeding. Gene therapy does not replace the altered factor VIII or IX gene on the male's X chromosome. So, the daughters of a man with hemophilia still will be carriers, even if he is treated with gene therapy. UCSF Benioff Children's Hospitals medical specialists have reviewed this information.

Even small cuts and bruises can be deadly, and routine movement can lead patients to bleed into their joints, destroying them. This is the disease that so terrified the last Russian Tsarina that she sought the care of a strange mystic, Rasputin, to care for her son, Alexei. Her faith in a strange mystic helped undermine faith in the royal family, helping lead to the revolution that led to their deaths. Scientists now know there are two forms of hemophilia, caused by defective genes for two different clotting factors needed to allow blood to coagulate. Both occur almost entirely in men. The more common form, hemophilia A, results from low levels of Factor VIII. It afflicts 16,000 men in the U.S., and more than 320,000 globally, according to the National Hemophilia Foundation. Hemophilia B, caused by a deficiency of clotting factor IX, afflicts about 4,000 Americans and 80,000 men globally. The BioMarin gene therapy treats hemophilia A; the Spark’s results on Thursday were for hemophila B. Care of hemophiliacs has been transformed by the ability of companies to derive Factor VIII and Factor IX from blood products, and through genetic engineering. These have become multibillion-dollar products, sold by Shire, Novo-Nordisk, and Bioverativ. One of the problems with these products is that some patients develop antibodies to their clotting factors. These can cause allergic reactions. It also means the clotting factors no longer work. These antibodies are called ‘inhibitors’, and 30% of hemophilia A patients develop them at some point.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d6\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.hemophilia.on.ca/resources/faqs/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"FAQs - Hemophilia Ontario Other approved treatments include hormone therapy — such as desmopressin — that stimulate the production of clotting factors and bypassing agents in cases in which the body develops antibodies against clotting factors. Several experimental treatments also are under evaluation. Top ↑ Can hemophilia be cured? There currently is no cure for hemophilia. However, the condition can be managed effectively with proper treatment. Top ↑ How is the severity of hemophilia determined? The level of clotting factor in the blood determines the severity of hemophilia. The lower the levels, the more severe the condition. In mild hemophilia, clotting factor levels are between 5% and 40% (0.05-0.40 IU/ml). In moderate hemophilia, clotting factor levels are between 1% and 5% (0.01-0.05 IU/ml). In severe hemophilia, clotting factor levels are less than 1% (0.01 IU/ml). The rate of bleeding differs based on the severity of the condition. People with severe hemophilia bleed frequently and for no specific reason. Those with moderate hemophilia bleed less frequently and spontaneously and usually only as a result of injury. In cases of mild hemophilia, excessive bleeding usually occurs only as a result of surgery or a major injury. Top ↑ Is hemophilia contagious? No. Hemophilia is an inherited condition and cannot be spread through physical contact. Top ↑ Are there any medication that patients should avoid? People with hemophilia should not take aspirin or any other blood thinner. Aspirin prevents blood cells called platelets from clumping together and forming blood clots. It can make bleeding worse in hemophilia patients. Top ↑ Is it safe to exercise? Sports and exercise can help strengthen the muscles and prevent bleeding. Therefore, individuals with hemophilia are encouraged to incorporate frequent exercise in their routine.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d7\",\n    \"source_url\": \"http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=5767\",\n    \"snippet\": \"UCSB Science Line We would have to change the genetic sequence of the person to permanently cure them. We would need to introduce a non- mutated, \\\"correct\\\" form of the specific gene that is causing the hemophilia in order to cure someone. There are also different forms of hemophilia that result from mutations in different genes. Fortunately scientists have been developing different ways to be able to help people with problems with their DNA. They will hopefully be able to replace mutated genes with healthy ones in the future. Answer 3: This is a really complicated question because the biology of diseases is naturally complex. Human bodies are never totally isolated and always have multiple factors that determine how they react when something goes wrong. Hemophilia cannot be cured because it is a genetic disorder. This means that the problem comes from an error in a person’s DNA. Since every single cell in a person’s body has their own copy of DNA, every single cell has the same disorder. Repairing broken or incorrect DNA is really hard for scientists because DNA is protected and guarded in the cell’s nucleus. Although scientists have a few ways to alter or rewrite DNA, the technique isn’t perfect enough to be used on humans yet. Furthermore, it would be almost impossible to edit every single cell in a person’s body to eliminate the disorder entirely. This idea is really complicated but considering ideas like these are the first steps to becoming scientist! Thank you for the question! Answer 4: It's genetic. People with hemophilia lack a protein that causes blood to clot. Their bodies cannot make this protein because the copy of the gene that they carry and which is responsible for this protein is defective. Because it's not possible currently to alter a person's DNA in a controlled fashion, hemophilia is incurable.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d8\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://ashpublications.org/bloodadvances/article/2/20/2780/16101/Implementing-emicizumab-in-hemophilia-inhibitor\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Implementing emicizumab in hemophilia inhibitor management ... Hemophilia is an X-linked bleeding disorder characterized by deficiency of factor VIII (FVIII), known as hemophilia A, or FIX, known as hemophilia B, which left untreated results in early death and permanent disability. Currently, patients receiving clotting factor replacement concentrates (CFCs) can expect to have healthy joints and a normal life expectancy.1 Unfortunately, a common complication of CFCs is the development of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors), which render factor therapy ineffective. For inhibitor patients, bleeding can be treated either episodically or prophylactically with bypassing agents (activated prothrombin complex concentrates [APCC; FEIBA, Shire, Dublin, Ireland] or recombinant activated factor VII [rFVIIa; Novoseven, Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark]); however, these agents are not as effective as replacing the missing factor with CFCs.2 As such, patients with inhibitors have both worse morbidity3,4 and mortality.5 Thus, the major goal for such patients is eradicating the inhibitor. The only known effective approach to achieve this involves repeated injections of CFCs, a treatment modality called immune tolerance induction (ITI). Considering the subject of this debate, the remainder of the discussion will be restricted to inhibitors in hemophilia A. More specifically, this therapy involves daily or every-other-day injection of CFC, and as ITI is usually conducted in young children, a central venous catheter (CVC) is often required, and the treatment burden and costs are very high. Finally, this approach is effective in ∼70% of cases but is lower (∼40%) in an intention-to-treat analysis demonstrating the difficulty of adhering to ITI.6 Although achieving a higher success rate is an important goal for the future, ITI, nevertheless, remains the most effective way to eradicate inhibitors.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d9\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.chula.ac.th/en/highlight/95180/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"“Hemophilia” – a Disease that May Not Be Cured But Opportunities ...

A Chula medical specialist recommends preventive replacement factor treatment that uses an application to record abnormal bleeding along with regular communication with one’s physician. Bleeding when one is wounded is a common occurrence for everyone. Yet there are cases where a person experiences bleeding without having had any cuts or wounds. There can also be instances of bleeding without any wounds or only a slight injury and the bleeding shows no sign of stopping especially in the joints or muscles. These symptoms shouldn’t be ignored since they might mean that a person has Hemophilia. Dr. Chatphatai Moonla, General Medicine Instructor, General Practitioner in Hematologic Diseases, Division of General Medicine, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital explains that “Hemophilia is a genetic disease that is found only in males. Out of a population of ten to twenty thousand, one hemophiliac might be found. This disease is caused by a genetic disorder that impairs the body’s ability to make blood clot. Patients usually display abnormal bleeding patterns from the time of their birth while in some cases they are found in their childhood or adolescence if they experience joint bleeds or easy bruising during the motor development process.” At present, around 1,800 people suffer from Hemophilia but it is hoped that more patients can be diagnosed, especially those displaying only mild symptoms. This would require more awareness among the public and medical professionals in all areas to realize the importance of detecting this disease. What causes Hemophilia Hemophilia is caused by a disorder of the gene that creates the coagulation factor which is called factor for short. There are two important factors: factor VIII and factor IX.

Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Other studies have experimented with different sound levels and even the kinds of things that are said to plants. Do they respond better to compliments or insults? Royal Horticultural Society Study In the month-long study, the Royal Horticultural Society recorded 10 people, including both men and women, reading from either literary or scientific works. Each recording was played through a set of headphones that was attached to each tomato plant's pot (so, one tomato plant per person). The same tomato variety was used, same soil, same care regimen, etc. They also included two plants that were not read to as a control. At the end of the month, the plants that had been attached to female voices grew an average of an inch taller than those attached to a male voice. The overall winning tomato listened to Sarah Darwin, the great-great-granddaughter of Charles Darwin. Her plant grew approximately two inches taller than the rest. What Did Ms. Darwin Read to Her Tomato Plant? Asked about her plant's favorable response to her voice and selection, Sarah Darwin commented, \\\"I'm not sure if it's my dulcet tones or the text that I read from 'On the Origin of Species' [her ancestor's seminal work] that made the plant sit up and listen, but either way I think it is great fun and I'm proud of my new title. \\\" Sound Science? Researchers went into the RHS study with the idea that the male voice would make the plants grow faster, and they were surprised by the results. They said that they are unsure why the female voice worked better, positing that it could be related to women's greater range of pitch or tone that affects the sound waves that hit the plant, and that sound, just like any other environmental factor, has an effect on plant growth.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://blog.gardenuity.com/talking-to-plants/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Talking to Plants | Can Plants Hear & Is There an Impact - THE SAGE In this study, there were 10 tomato plants, 8 of which had headphones placed around their pots.

In order to provide your plants with stimulating conversation, you don’t have to give each pot a pair of headphones (although, no one is stopping you from going that extra mile!) What you can do is simply talk to your plants or start talking around your plants in order to help them grow. Research by South Korea’s National Institute of Agricultural Biotechnology shows that plants begin to react to sound at 70 decibels. Lucky for us, 70 decibels is the sound level for the average human conversation. The more and the louder you talk or play music around your plants, the more stimulated they will be. How do Plants Respond to their Environment? In research conducted by Evolutionary Biologist, Monica Gagliano, evidence shows that pea seedlings reacted to the sounds of their environment. The sound introduced to these seedlings was the sound of running water. One tray had an enclosed plastic tube of running water at the end of it, and one had dry soil at the end, but BOTH trays of seedlings grew towards the sound of the water. Plants not only hear your speaking, but they hear the things that will help them grow best. How amazing is that? What is the Effect of Sound on Plants? Speaking, playing music, and natural noises provided from the environment all play a part in how your plant grows. Rich Marini, from Penn State’s horticultural department, even suggests that plants respond to vibrations from sound waves because they are similar to how a plant is stimulated by the wind.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://plantedtogrow.com/speaking-negatively-to-plants-can-it-affect-them/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Speaking Negatively to Plants: Can It Affect Them? - Planted To Grow Here are a few ideas to help you spread positivity to your plant. Read something out loud nearby. This could be the book you are reading, an article you are interested in, or even information about the plant itself. Spend time on a regular basis taking care of it. During your watering or feeding time, tell your plant what you like about it or how it is doing. Many people talk to their pets as they play with them or otherwise, so it’s just as easy to do that as you water your plants or maintain them! Talking to Plants May Also Be Good for You In addition to talking to your plants to help them, it may also be a great way to care for yourself. Not only are plants proven to be a great way to enhance the environment that you live in, but plants have therapeutic benefits for you as well. Plants are ideal for those who deal with: Depression Anxiety Stress Even using your plants as a sort of therapist can help you feel less burned or stressed, but it can also make your plant feel more cared for. Caring for plants has also been proven to be a great form of Eco therapy that can benefit many people with mental health concerns. More and more doctors and nurses are encouraging people of all ages to take up planting as a way of connecting to themselves and the earth more. Getting away from technology, out of your own mind, and even the mobility it takes to take care of plants can help many individuals. Final Thoughts Even though talking to your snake plant in the corner of your living room may seem like a strange idea, it is one of the best ways to ensure that your plant is growing to its’ full potential. Here are a few ways talking can help your plant: Increase in overall height Quicker growing time More or larger blooms Talking to plants is not a new idea. It has quite a lot of historical and scientific data that have been able to show that the vibrations from talking can respond to the water structure and the overall health of a plant, and how much it can grow.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2018/how-to-talk-to-your-plants/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"How to Talk to Your Plants: Using LEDs to grow better crops ... How to Talk to Your Plants: Using LEDs to grow better crops Plants are terrible listeners. I’ve told the plants on my windowsill, “Grow taller, grow faster! Make more delicious leaves for me to put in my food!”, but they just grow in the same slow way they’ve been doing since I bought them. Farmers and florists share my pain, but on a larger scale. Sometimes, no matter what you do the squash isn’t big enough to be a prize winner and the roses flower a little too early or too late for Valentine’s Day. If only plants could hear our requests. Alas, while the old rumor about talking to your plants to help them grow might be a little bittrue, using sound waves isn’t specific or effective enough to change how we grow plants on a large scale. To do that we’re turning to a different kind of wave to get through to plants — light. Different “Kinds” of Light Plants use light to do many things. The first that probably comes to mind is making food, or energy. Plants convert light into energy through photosynthesis. But they also use light to decide which direction to grow, how long to make their stem, how large to make their leaves, when to flower and more. To tell plants to grow in a particular way, farmers need to know two things. First, what kinds of light lead to which response. Next, how do we give our indoor plants just those kinds of light. These “kinds” of light I’m referring to are the different wavelengths of light (Figure 1). When we’re talking about light we can see, we’re talking about different colors of light. Longer wavelengths appear to our eyes as red while shorter wavelengths appear to our eyes as violet. But there is also light that our eyes can’t see, but that our bodies can feel. Wavelengths even longer than red light, or infrared light, makes us feel warm. While wavelengths smaller than violet are called ultraviolet (or UV) which causes sunburn.

Communicating with Plants – Is it at all possible? The idea of talking to plants might be deemed crazy and nonsense for many people. Plants don’t have brains and are not capable of communicating in any form. However, recent studies reveal that they actually “communicate” with each other and can even respond when humans communicate with them. Though there are no definitive conclusions in regard to plant communication, it is now acknowledged as a valid study in the scientific community. Those who are involved in this kind of study are already treated with respect and not considered as lunatics as they once were. The concept of plants benefiting from human conversation can be traced back to 1848. German professor Gustav Fechner published a book called Nanna or Soul-life of Plants. His idea became popular and has inspired many researchers to take a closer look at the scientific evidence that plants can really respond to human conversation. How human conversation affects plant growth Rich Marini of Penn’s State Horticulture Department said that plant growth can be induced by many factors such as wind or vibration. Since sounds are basically vibrations, human conversation to plants may cause possible changes. Korean researchers published a result of their study in 2007 and it adhered with the idea of Marini. They tested playing sounds at 70 decibels near the plants and they responded. Their genes became active during the process. The study also concluded that as the frequency increased, gene activity also increased. The way plants evolved in such a way that they respond to vibrations is mainly affected by the need to survive windy environments. In windy places, we see plants that are shorter but with thicker stems. This is necessary for them to stay alive. Therefore, a lot of researchers believe that conversing with plants can really affect their growth. There are also some theories suggesting that it could be the carbon dioxide released by humans when talking that actually helps plants grow. However, skeptics say that if this idea were true, it would take several hours for humans to talk before plants could get the necessary carbon dioxide they need to grow. Can plants talk with each other? In a study released in 1983, there was a shocking revelation about plants being able to communicate with each other.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d6\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://sites.psu.edu/siowfa15/2015/09/17/can-talking-to-plants-help-them-grow/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Can talking to plants help them grow? | SiOWfa15: Science in Our ... The course website and blog for the Fall 2015 instance of Penn State's SC200 course Can talking to plants help them grow? I remember hearing in my high school science class that talking to plants could potentially help their growth. Since I enjoy planting flowers, I’ve always been curious, yet skeptical about this claim. However, research has shown that some element of talking, or just sound in general, may truly be helping plants grow faster and healthier. There are a few theories as to why scientists believe talking may help plants grow. One theory is that the carbon dioxide we breath on the plants while talking to them helps growth, but there is very little supporting evidence for that. Another theory is that talking causes vibrations and scientists “have found evidence that plants do react to a number of environmental stimuli in which they rely on for survival, this includes vibrations.” (ProFlowers) Since vibrations have been found to stimulate plants, it would make sense that vibrations from speaking can have a positive impact on the growth of plants. Multiple studies have been conducted to test the sound and vibration theory, one of which was done on a show called Myth Busters. They did an experiment where they had greenhouses set up with either no music, looped recordings, or various genres of music playing. The results showed that the plants had the best growth rate in the greenhouses that had music playing. The plants in the greenhouses that played recordings still grew faster than the control plants. Another reason researchers believe sound may improve plant growth is because “a 2007 paper from scientists at South Korea’s National Institute of Agricultural Biotechnology proposed that two genes involved in a plant’s response to light—known as rbcS and Ald—are turned on by music played at 70 decibels.” (Stevenson) That amount of decibels is about the same level as someone speaking, so both talking or music can potentially help activate these genes in plants. In fact, there is a new social experiment taking place at the moment called “Talk to a Plant”. It’s a study where people send tweets to an account and then the tweets are read to the plants.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d7\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://juniperlandscape.com/talking-plants-help-grow/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Does Talking To Your Plants Help Them Grow? Does Talking To Your Plants Help Them Grow? Is there any truth to the notion that talking to your plants will help them grow? The adage has been around for ages, and many people scoff at the idea. When Prince Charles revealed during a 1986 interview that he regularly talked to the plants in his garden, he was ridiculed by many throughout the world. But there is some evidence that suggests there’s at least some truth to the idea that audible words do in fact have a positive effect on plants and their growth. We’ll talk about it in this issue. What evidence is there that plants respond to sound? While there’s not a lot of data about the subject, there is some. One study in particular, conducted by scientists at South Korea’s National Institute of Agricultural Biotechnology, received quite a bit of press. They proposed that two genes (rbcS and Ald) involved in a plant’s response to light are also stimulated by music played at 70 decibels – which is the typical level of a normal human conversation. In that particular experiment, the scientists found that plants showed different responses to different frequencies of sound. In fact, the gene response showed more response as the frequency was increased. Mythbusters Back in the U.S., producers of the hit show Mythbusters tried to find answers to whether or not plants react to human voices. The team divided 60 pea plants into 3 greenhouse groups: One was exposed to recorded voices of loving praise Another was exposed to recorded voices of cruel insults The third was exposed to no human voices The two groups that were exposed to human voices showed positive growth, while the third (the one without exposure to voice) showed poor growth.

Overall, talking to plants may have minor or situational benefits, but research has not confirmed a consistent or strong effect. [d4]\n[[END-OF-ANSWER]]"}]}

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, January 20, Monday. George Washington's Birthday, February 17, Monday. There are eleven annual U.S. federal holidays on the calendar designated by the United States Congress. Unlike many other countries, there are no “national holidays” in the United States because Congress only has constitutional authority to create holidays for federal institutions. Most federal holidays are also observed as state holidays. * When a legal public holiday falls on a Saturday, it is usually observed on the preceding Friday for pay and leave purposes. When the holiday falls on a Sunday, it is usually observed on the following Monday for pay and leave purposes. More about Federal Holidays In addition to the eleven annual federal holidays, Inauguration Day is a twelfth holiday designated by Congress for observance every four years on January 20 following a U.S. presidential election. It is only observed by government employees in Washington D.C. and the border counties of Maryland and Virginia. Though not technically accurate, U.S. federal holidays are often referred to as \\\"public holidays\\\" or \\\"legal holidays\\\" because of their wide spread observance. Bank holidays are usually the same as federal holidays since most banks follow the holiday calendar of the U.S. Federal Reserve. They tend to use the modern President’s Day for the observance of George Washington’s Birthday.

Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

The study found that when the population was exposed about four times per month to antismoking advertising campaigns, smoking prevalence decreased by 0.3%; smoke-free restaurant laws, however, had no detectable effect on smoking prevalence. In the United States, Fichtenberg and Glantz (2002) evaluated 26 studies of the effects of smoke-free workplaces in 2002; they found weak but significant inverse associations between completely smoke-free workplaces and smoking prevalence (3.8% reduction in prevalence; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.8–4.7%) and daily cigarette consumption in continuing smokers (3.1 fewer cigarettes; 95% CI, 2.4–3.8).

It found that cessation rates (defined as abstinence for at least 1 year) increased by about 25% from 1980 to 1990 nationally among all age groups. Cessation rates averaged 3.4% per year in the 1990s. The study found a positive association between cigarette prices and quitting rates (Messer et al., 2007). Albers et al.

Recommended Posts Last month, the Assembly Environment and Solid Waste Committee unanimously approved a proposal to ban smoking in all workplaces in New Jersey, including restaurants, casinos, and most bars. The bill is known as the Clean Indoor Air Act. Its goal is a sweeping ban similar to those recently enacted in New York City and New York State. It is now scheduled for a second hearing in the Assembly Health Committee. With the current state law, restaurants do not even have to provide non-smoking sections. All they have to do is put up a sign telling customers whether they have a non-smoking section, and many restaurants don't even do that. Bars are not covered. I'm sure this law will draw the typical response from the restaurant and cigarette trade-- whining about loss of business; But as we can see from New York and California, the restaurant business actually goes UP when these laws are enacted! Hope this bill passes ASAP!! I find it hard to imagine a smoke free bar! While business might have improved at some establishments, what about the \\\"old man bars\\\" as we used to call the small neighborhood places? I do hope it passes from a selfish point of view. I avoid establishments with smoking because I hate the smell. Even those with separate smoking areas are not able to completely keep the smoke in one place.

These bans were repealed in the revolutions of 1848.[27] Prior to 1865 Russia had a ban on smoking in the streets.[28] The first building in the world to ban smoking was the Old Government Building in Wellington, New Zealand in 1876. The ban related to concerns about the threat of fire, as it is the second largest wooden building in the world.[29] The first modern attempt at restricting smoking saw Nazi Germany banning smoking in every university, post office, military hospital, and Nazi Party office, under the auspices of Karl Astel's Institute for Tobacco Hazards Research, established in 1941 under orders from Adolf Hitler.[30] The Nazis conducted major anti-tobacco campaigns until the demise of their regime in 1945.[31] In the latter part of the 20th century, as research on the risks of secondhand tobacco smoke became public, the tobacco industry launched \\\"courtesy awareness\\\" campaigns. Fearing reduced sales, the industry began a media and legislative programme that focused upon \\\"accommodation\\\". Tolerance and courtesy were encouraged as a way to ease heightened tensions between smokers and those around them, while avoiding smoking bans. In the US, states were encouraged to pass laws providing separate smoking sections.[32] In 1975 the U.S. state of Minnesota enacted the Minnesota Clean Indoor Air Act, making it the first state to restrict smoking in most public spaces.

California leads in protecting workers from secondhand smoke and vape Everyone has the right to a workplace that’s free of dangerous secondhand smoke. While this idea seems simple now, it was revolutionary in 1995 when California became the first state to ban smoking in nearly every workplace, including in public buildings, indoor public spaces, and restaurants.1 Three years later, that ban extended to include bars, taverns, and gaming clubs.2 With the addition of this law, most indoor workplaces across the state were covered by secondhand smoke protection policies. In 2016, California expanded the types of tobacco products banned from use in indoor workplaces to include vapes and marijuana.34 And in January 2024, a law was updated requiring all California hotel and motel rooms to be 100 percent smoke-free took effect, marking another huge win in protecting workers and guests alike.5 Today, California’s clean indoor air protections are some of the strongest in the nation, eliminating most secondhand smoke exposure in the workplace, making it safer for employees and customers to do business.6 “If nobody else is stepping up, you're nominated.” Andrea San Diego, CA When Andrea got sick from secondhand smoke in her Los Angeles office, she made history by suingfor assault and battery.

Although a Utah law prohibiting smoking in restaurants took effect in 1995, smoking was still allowed in worksites and bars in that state until 2009. Comprehensive smoke-free laws were rare even at the local level until the 2000s. In 1990, the community of San Luis Obispo, California, adopted the first law in the United States eliminating smoking in bars. During the 1990s, smoke-free bar laws were largely limited to communities in California and Massachusetts. The progress made during the past decade in enacting comprehensive state smoke-free laws is an extraordinary public health achievement. In the span of 10 years, smoke-free workplaces, restaurants, and bars went from being relatively rare to being the norm in half of the states and DC. Several factors appear to have contributed to this outcome. First, smoke-free laws increasingly were viewed as a worker protection measure that should apply to all employees, including those in restaurants and bars (1). Second, as state and local smoke-free laws were enacted across the country, other states and communities learned from the experiences of similar jurisdictions and were able to adapt and implement such laws (1,7). For example, New York City's adoption of a comprehensive smoke-free law in 2002 drew substantial news media coverage and established that a smoke-free law could be implemented successfully in a large, diverse, metropolitan setting (1). Finally, the Surgeon General's 2006 report, The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke (1), presented several important conclusions about the health risks associated with SHS exposure and effective protection approaches, generated extensive news media coverage, and was cited by a number of state and local policymakers as influencing their decisions on this topic.

Utah also enacted a restaurant smoking ban in 1995, while Delaware followed with a comprehensive smoke-free law in 2002 [d9]. Other jurisdictions implemented similar measures later, such as New Jersey’s proposed ban in 2003, India’s public-place ban in 2003, Ireland’s national ban in 2004, and Michigan’s around 2010 [d2][d5][d6][d8].\n[[END-OF-ANSWER]]"}]}

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only.

Chamber Jr., is that the government had botched the attempt to apprehend John Jr.[168] The defense's case, too, had a problem. The defense never followed up on inconsistencies in Weichmann's chronology of Mary's last visit to the tavern, which could have undermined Weichmann's entire credibility.[168] A newspaper drawing of Surratt receiving comfort from one of the priests permitted to visit her in her prison cell. The military tribunal considered guilt and sentencing on June 29 and 30.[168] Surratt's guilt was the second-last to be considered, as her case had problems of evidence and witness reliability.[168] The sentence was handed down on June 30.[169] The military tribunal found her guilty on all charges but two.[170] A death sentence required six of the nine votes of the judges.[169][171] Surratt was sentenced to death, the first woman executed by the federal government.[4][23] The sentence was announced publicly on July 5.[172][173][174] When Powell learned of his sentence, he declared that she was completely innocent of all charges.[175] The night before the execution, Surratt's priests and Anna Surratt both visited Powell and elicited from him a strong statement declaring Mary innocent. Although it was delivered to Captain Christian Rath, who was overseeing the execution, Powell's statement had no effect on anyone with authority to prevent Surratt's death.[176] George Atzerodt bitterly condemned her, implicating her even further in the conspiracy.[175] Powell's was the only statement by any conspirator exonerating Surratt.[176] Anna Surratt pleaded repeatedly for her mother's life with Judge Advocate General Joseph Holt, but he refused to consider clemency.[63]\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.womenshistory.org/articles/first-woman-executed-us-government\",\n    \"snippet\": \"The First Woman Executed by the US Government At 1:22pm on July 7, 1865, Mary Surratt became the first woman ever to be executed by the United States government.

SURRATT, to be hanged by the neck until she be dead, at such time and place as the President of the United States shall direct. At 1:22pm on July 7, 1865, Mary Surratt became the first woman ever to be executed by the United States government. Surratt, Lewis Powell (aka Lewis Payne), David Herold, and George Atzerodt were all involved in John Wilkes Booth’s elaborate plot to completely disrupt the Union government by killing President Abraham Lincoln, Vice President Andrew Johnson, and Secretary of State William Seward. Atzerodt was supposed to kill Johnson, but he got cold feet and got drunk instead. Powell was supposed to kill Seward, but Seward survived his attack. Herold brought Powell to Seward’s home and helped Booth escape Washington, DC. Surratt, according to Johnson, “kept the nest that hatched the egg.” She, it was believed by many, was the center around which the whole plot evolved. After a month long trial and just two days of deliberation, all four were charged with conspiring to assassinate the President of the United States and were sentenced to hang for their crime. In June and early July of 1865, Mary Surratt was the most hated woman in the country and there was little doubt in Americans’ minds that she played a definite role in the assassination plot. For the almost 150 years since her death, though, public opinion has been somewhat divided. For nearly her whole life, Mary Surratt lived just outside of Washington, DC in Prince George’s County, Maryland. She and her husband ran a successful tavern/hotel in the county and, in the early 1850s, the area surrounding the their business was named Surrattsville (now Clinton, Maryland). Maryland was a slave state and Surratts owned slaves whose labor they depended on to keep up their business. This was especially true when Surratt’s husband died and she was left to run things herself.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2013-07-07\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/stories/women-executed-in-the-us-1900-2015\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Women Executed in the US: 1900-2021 Women Executed in the US: 1900 – 2021 ; Date of Execution, 1/​1/​1943 ; Name, ROSANNA PHILLIPS ; Race, B.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathsheba_Spooner\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Bathsheba Spooner - Wikipedia Bathsheba Ruggles Spooner (February 15, 1746 – July 2, 1778) was the first woman in American history to be executed following the Declaration of Independence.

Mary Surratt is first woman executed by U.S. federal government Surratt, who owned a tavern in Surrattsville (now Clinton), Maryland, had to convert her row house in Washington, D.C., into a boardinghouse as a result of financial difficulties. Located a few blocks from Ford’s Theatre, where Lincoln was murdered, this house served as the place where a group of Confederate supporters, including John Wilkes Booth, conspired to assassinate the president. It was Surratt’s association with Booth that ultimately led to her conviction, though debate continues as to the extent of her involvement and whether it really warranted so harsh a sentence. The Lincoln Assassination Plot On the day of the assassination, Booth asked Surratt to deliver a package, which was later discovered to contain firearms, to her old tavern in Maryland. On her way home, Surratt ran into John Lloyd, a former Washington police officer who currently leased the tavern. When authorities first questioned Lloyd about their encounter, he did not mention anything significant and denied that Booth and David Herold had visited his tavern. Yet when questioned later, he claimed that Surratt had told him to have whiskey and weapons ready for Booth and Herold, who would be stopping by that night. Louis Weichmann, one of the alleged conspirators who delivered the package with Surratt, was released after he testified against her. He later claimed that the government had forced him to testify, and that it plagued his conscience for the rest of his life. Furthermore, Lewis Powell, a conspirator who was hanged with Surratt, proclaimed her innocence to his executioner minutes before his death. Many expected President Andrew Johnson to pardon Surratt because the U.S. government had never hanged a woman. The execution was delayed until the afternoon, and soldiers were stationed on every block between the White House and Fort McNair, the execution site, to relay the expected pardon. But the order never came.

Mary Surratt was the first woman executed by the US government when she was hanged in 1865 after being found guilty of being a conspirator ... Though the death penalty has been around in the US since European settlers made their way over, with the first recorded execution in 1608, it wasn't until more than 200 years later the first woman was handed the death penalty. In July 1865 Mary Surratt was hanged after being convicted of being part of the conspiracy which led to the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln earlier that year. Mary maintained that she was innocent until her death, with her case against her seen as controversial at the time, and still sparks debate to this day. Mary Elizabeth Jenkins Surratt was born on a tobacco plantation near the southern Maryland town of Waterloo, with sources differing as to whether she was born in 1820 or 1823. She married John Harrison Surratt in 1840 and the couple used land from John's wealthy adopted parents to eventually build their own hamlet, Surrattsville. A tavern and inn were built on farmland near what is now Clinton, and by the time of the Civil War, the couple, who were Confederate sympathisers, were using their tavern as a safe house for Confederate spies.. In August 1862, John, a known alcoholic, collapsed suddenly and died due to a stroke. Mary opens a boarding house This left the family in serious financial difficulties as he had racked up numerous debts. In 1864, Mary took possession of a townhouse the couple owned in Washington DC, which had been rented out. She moved to the four-storey gray brick house in December that year, and the same day she leased the tavern in Surrattsville. She used the local Daily Evening Star newspaper to advertise for lodgers for her townhouse, which had four rooms to let. It was here that the pieces would begin to fall into place for the plan to assassinate President Abraham Lincoln.

A Documentary Record of the Hanging of the First Woman in Illinois A jury of twelve men convicted Elizabeth Reed in 1845 of murdering her husband by poisoning him. She was ordered to be hanged by the neck until dead, giving Lawrence County the dubious title of hanging the first woman in Illinois. The story has become a part of the county’s history and even inspired a historical novel, but what were the facts? By researching the actual documents and the laws at that time, a different story emerged. The facts of this case have now been presented in a book of actual documents and a three-act play written and performed. Summary Rick Kelsheimer, owner of a bowling alley in Crawford County and amateur historian, wrote a historical fiction book titled The Hanging of Betsey Reed: A Wabash River Tragedy on the Illinois Frontier in 2007. He presented a program to the Lawrence County Historical Society several years ago, and at that time several of our researchers questioned his “facts.” He freely admitted that, while he had read the court papers and newspaper accounts of the trial, he had embellished many facts to create a more marketable book. This ‘embellishing’ was what actually caused the Lawrence County Historical Society to undertake this project. This is a story about a trial and an execution of a woman who was convicted of poisoning her husband. When she was executed, she became the first woman hanged in Illinois. The facts of this significant historical event deserved to be told. While it is somewhat of a dubious honor for our county to be the first to hand a woman in Illinois, the Lawrence County Historical Society felt that the State’s bicentennial was the appropriate time to research and present this chapter in forgotten Illinois history. The Research and the Book Illinois law was quite different in 1845, and this was especially true for criminal law. Relying only on the existing court documents for the Reed murder case and interpreting them based on present criminal law did not present an accurate picture. One had to understand the legal procedures used in the case at that time. The first task of Donna Burton, retired attorney, was one of researching Illinois legal history.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Freedom of opinion and expression are, indeed, cornerstones of human rights and pillars of free and democratic societies. These freedoms support other fundamental rights, such as to peaceful assembly, to participate in public affairs, and to freedom of religion. It is undeniable that digital media, including social media, have bolstered the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas. Therefore, legislative efforts to regulate free expression unsurprisingly raise concerns that attempts to curb hate speech may silence dissent and opposition. To counter hate speech, the United Nations supports more positive speech and upholds respect for freedom of expression as the norm. Therefore, any restrictions must be an exception and seek to prevent harm and ensure equality or the public participation of all. Alongside the relevant international human rights law provisions, the UN Rabat Plan of Action provides key guidance to States on the difference between freedom of expression and “incitement” (to discrimination, hostility and violence), which is prohibited under criminal law. Determining when the potential of harm is high enough to justify prohibiting speech is still the subject of much debate. But States can also use alternative tools – such as education and promoting counter-messages – to address the whole spectrum of hateful expression, both on and offline. “Addressing hate speech does not mean limiting or prohibiting freedom of speech. It means keeping hate speech from escalating into something more dangerous, particularly incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, which is prohibited under international law.”\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/hate\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Hate Speech and Hate Crime | Advocacy, Legislation & Issues Hate Speech and Hate Crime Hate Speech There is no legal definition of \\\"hate speech\\\" under U.S. law, just as there is no legal definition for evil ideas, rudeness, unpatriotic speech, or any other kind of speech that people might condemn. Generally, however, hate speech is any form of expression through which speakers intend to vilify, humiliate, or incite hatred against a group or a class of persons on the basis of race, religion, skin color sexual identity, gender identity, ethnicity, disability, or national origin. 1 In the United States, hate speech is protected by the First Amendment. Courts extend this protection on the grounds that the First Amendment requires the government to strictly protect robust debate on matters of public concern even when such debate devolves into distasteful, offensive, or hateful speech that causes others to feel grief, anger, or fear. (The Supreme Court's decision in Snyder v. Phelps provides an example of this legal reasoning.) Under current First Amendment jurisprudence, hate speech can only be criminalized when it directly incites imminent criminal activity or consists of specific threats of violence targeted against a person or group. Hate Crime For the purposes of collecting statistics, the FBI has defined a hate crime as a “criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity,” including skin color and national origin. Hate crimes are overt acts that can include acts of violence against persons or property, violation or deprivation of civil rights, certain \\\"true threats,\\\" or acts of intimidation, or conspiracy to commit these crimes. The Supreme Court has upheld laws that either criminalize these acts or impose a harsher punishment when it can be proven that the defendant targeted the victim because of the victim's race, ethnicity, identity, or beliefs. A hate crime is more than than offensive speech or conduct; it is specific criminal behavior that ranges from property crimes like vandalism and arson to acts of intimidation, assault, and murder.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_in_the_United_States\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Hate speech in the United States - Wikipedia Hate speech in the United States cannot be directly regulated by the government due to the fundamental right to freedom of speech protected by the Constitution.[1] While \\\"hate speech\\\" is not a legal term in the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that most of what would qualify as hate speech in other western countries is legally protected speech under the First Amendment. In a Supreme Court case on the issue, Matal v. Tam (2017), the justices unanimously reaffirmed that there is effectively no \\\"hate speech\\\" exception to the free speech rights protected by the First Amendment and that the U.S. government may not discriminate against speech on the basis of the speaker's viewpoint.[2] In academic circles, there has been debate over freedom of speech, hate speech, and hate speech legislation.[3] Other forms of speech have lesser protection under court interpretations of the First Amendment, including commercial speech, \\\"fighting words\\\", and obscenity. The protection of civil liberties, including freedom of speech, was not written into the original 1788 Constitution of the United States but was added two years later with the Bill of Rights, implemented as several amendments to the Constitution. The First Amendment, ratified December 15, 1791, provides (in relevant part) that \\\"Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press\\\". The Fourteenth Amendment, ratified on July 9, 1868, has been interpreted by the Supreme Court as extending this prohibition to laws enacted by the states. In 1942, the issue of group defamation was first most explicitly brought up in Chaplinsky v.

The ACLU has often been at the center of controversy for defending the free speech rights of groups that spew hate, such as the Ku Klux Klan and the Nazis. But if only popular ideas were protected, we wouldn’t need a First Amendment. History teaches that the first target of government repression is never the last. If we do not come to the defense of the free speech rights of the most unpopular among us, even if their views are antithetical to the very freedom the First Amendment stands for, then no one’s liberty will be secure. In that sense, all First Amendment rights are “indivisible.” Censoring so-called hate speech also runs counter to the long-term interests of the most frequent victims of hate: racial, ethnic, religious and sexual minorities. We should not give the government the power to decide which opinions are hateful, for history has taught us that government is more apt to use this power to prosecute minorities than to protect them. As one federal judge has put it, tolerating hateful speech is “the best protection we have against any Nazi-type regime in this country.” At the same time, freedom of speech does not prevent punishing conduct that intimidates, harasses, or threatens another person, even if words are used. Threatening phone calls, for example, are not constitutionally protected. SPEECH & NATIONAL SECURITY The Supreme Court has recognized the government’s interest in keeping some information secret, such as wartime troop deployments. But the Court has never actually upheld an injunction against speech on national security grounds. Two lessons can be learned from this historical fact. First, the amount of speech that can be curtailed in the interest of national security is very limited. And second, the government has historically overused the concept of “national security” to shield itself from criticism, and to discourage public discussion of controversial policies or decisions. In 1971, the publication of the “Pentagon Papers” by the New York Times brought the conflicting claims of free speech and national security to a head.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d5\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.aclu.org/news/free-speech/free-speech-can-be-messy-we-need-it\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Free Speech Can Be Messy, but We Need It | ACLU Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.

She was going to speak, school officials said there would be riots, and they canceled her talk. Both of these individuals then spent 2017 identifying as victims of liberal censorship. And my god the media ate it up — they got more attention for being silenced than they did for trying to peddle actual substantive views. A goal of professional provocateurs is to provoke the campus community into trying to silence them. Think of campus trolls as schoolyard bullies. Oh, their words definitely hurt. But the real question is: How do we respond to that hurt? A troll wants you to censor them. It feeds into their power and gives them something to sell. You don’t have to play that role. Yes, there is power in hateful words. But there is also power in sass — in unwillingness to be goaded into a fight or to play the role of censor. But not all words wound in the same way. That brings us to our second myth: Hate speech isn’t protected by the First Amendment. I often hear younger people say that hate speech isn’t protected by the First Amendment. But that’s untrue.

Respect for the autonomy rights of speakers is a commitment of liberal justice, but it is not the only commitment. When the non-violation of the autonomy rights of speakers foreseeably leads to policies which will violate other, foundational, commitments of liberal justice such as the equal basic rights of citizens, it is unclear that violating the autonomy rights of speakers is unjustified, all things considered. My position here is, I believe, consistent with Rawls’s views about the priority of a coherent scheme of basic liberties. Priority for a scheme of liberties rather than for any one liberty ‘implies in practice that a basic liberty can be limited or denied solely for the sake of one or more other basic liberties, [but never] for reasons of public good or of perfectionist values’ (Rawls (1993, p. 295). Having suggested that restrictions on this category of hate speech do not violate unjustly free speech rights, and in light of the obvious harms of such speech, I conclude that this hate speech category is clearly covered as political speech, but nonetheless unprotected and therefore regulable. I would stress, however, that my position is silent on whether such speech should be regulated, and is certainly silent on the authority question—who should decide when speech properly counts as falling within this category, in virtue of its foreseeably leading to the adoption of policies which exclude or eliminate identifiable racial or religious groups. It may be the case that no government can reliably be given the authority to make this difficult judgment without opening the way for abuse. Even if that is the case, however, my position here is, in my view, not affected—it deals with the first-order question of whether this category of speech is in principle regulable under the FSP.

And that censorship of hate speech, no matter how well-intended, has been shown around the world and throughout history to do more harm than good in actually promoting equality, dignity, inclusivity, diversity, and societal harmony. On hateful speech and why it's legal (most of the time) You very frequently get public officials and even lawyers saying \\\"hate speech is not free speech.\\\" But that is not correct! The Supreme Court never has created a category of speech that is defined by its hateful conduct, labeled it hate speech, and said that that is categorically excluded by the first amendment. Speech cannot be punished just because of its hateful content. But when you get beyond content and look at context, speech with a hateful message may be punished, if in a particular context it directly causes certain specific, imminent, serious harm — such as a genuine threat that means to instill a reasonable fear on the part of the person at whom the threat is targeted that he or she is going be subject to violence.

Exercising these rights – without fear or unlawful interference – is central to living in an open and fair society; one in which people can access justice and enjoy their human rights. Yet governments around the world routinely imprison people – or worse – for speaking out, even though almost every country’s constitution refers to the value of ‘free speech’. Governments have a duty to prohibit hateful, inciteful speech but many abuse their authority to silence peaceful dissent by passing laws criminalizing freedom of expression. This is often done in the name of counterterrorism, national security or religion. More recently, freedom of expression has come under threat by authorities clamping down on activists, NGOs and individuals helping refugees and migrants. How governments tolerate unfavourable views or critical voices is often a good indication of how they treat human rights generally. Amnesty International supports people who speak out peacefully for themselves and for others – whether a journalist reporting on violence by security forces, a trade unionist exposing poor working conditions or an indigenous leader defending their land rights against big business. We would similarly defend the right of those who support the positions of big business, the security forces and employers to express their views peacefully.

However, Minister McEntee said that hate speech is not about free speech – hate speech is designed to shut people down, to shut them up, to make them afraid to say who they are and to exclude and isolate them.

This will be an additional/alternative test to the ‘motivation test’ as previously outlined in the General Scheme of the Bill.

Some free speech advocates prefer an open marketplace of ideas, where no expression is restricted. They consider that the best response to harmful speech is through debate that lets different ideas freely challenge it. Others argue that restrictions on hate speech are vital to the protection of minority communities from the harm that such speech causes.2 Different approaches to what is acceptable speech can be seen around the world. The United States of America has traditionally been a country where the constitutional protection of free speech is vigorously defended.3 And yet, even there, many restrictions on free speech do exist, such as those against speech that incites “imminent lawless action”4 and those that censor obscenity.5 Some countries show a greater acceptance than others for prohibiting certain forms of speech and even the expression of certain opinions. For instance, some European countries have passed laws in accordance with a European Union Council decision to make it a punishable offence not only to incite hatred, but also to publicly deny crimes of genocide (e.g., the Holocaust) or war crimes.6 In other countries, strict limitations on free speech may go as far as to impose the death penalty for such crimes as apostasy, blasphemy or other statements that may be perceived to be opposed to the dominant religion.7 In Canada, various laws at the federal, provincial and territorial levels impose restrictions on the freedom of expression guaranteed by section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.8 For instance, under the Criminal Code,9 such actions as defamatory libel, counselling suicide, perjury and fraud are prohibited. In 1990, then Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada Antonio Lamer described offences that address forms of speech or expression as falling under the following categories: offences against the public order, offences related to falsehood, offences against the person and reputation, offences against the administration of law and justice, and offences related to public morals and disorderly conduct.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d11\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/967/hate-speech\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Hate Speech | The First Amendment Encyclopedia Hate Speech The Supreme Court has struck down laws that have restricted offensive speech, such as the wearing of swastikas in Village of Skokie v.

Although the First Amendment still protects much hate speech, there has been substantial debate on the subject in the past two decades among lawmakers, jurists, and legal scholars. Debate over hate speech flared over campus speech codes The scholarly debate concerning the regulation of hate speech flared in the late 1980s, primarily focusing on campus speech codes, pitting those who view regulation of hate speech as a necessary step toward social equality against those who see hate speech regulations as abridgements of the fundamental right of free speech. Liberal theorists say more speech is the First Amendment remedy for hate speech The traditional liberal position is that speech must be valued as one of the most important elements of a democratic society. Traditional scholars see speech as a fundamental tool for self-realization and social growth and believe that the remedy for troublesome speech is more speech, not more government regulation of speech. For example, liberal theorist Nadine Strossen, relying to some degree on John Stuart Mill’s connection between speech and the search for truth, argues that restricting hate speech will mask hatred among groups rather than dissipate it. Balance between free speech and social equality a concern Proponents of hate speech regulation usually do so from the perspective of critical race theory, believing that legal decisions are based on preserving the interests of the powerful, and see no value in protecting bias-motivated speech against certain already oppressed groups.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d12\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.coe.int/en/web/european-commission-against-racism-and-intolerance/hate-speech-and-violence\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Hate speech and violence - European Commission against Racism ... Hate speech and violence Hate speech covers many forms of expressions which advocate, incite, promote or justify hatred, violence and discrimination against a person or group of persons for a variety of reasons. It poses grave dangers for the cohesion of a democratic society, the protection of human rights and the rule of law. If left unaddressed, it can lead to acts of violence and conflict on a wider scale. In this sense hate speech is an extreme form of intolerance which contributes to hate crime. Aware of the dangerous link between hate speech and violence, ECRI has always considered that criminal prohibition is necessary when hate speech publicly incites violence against individuals or groups of people. At the same time criminal sanctions should be used as a measure of last resort and, all along, a balance must be kept between fighting hate speech on the one hand, and safeguarding freedom of speech on the other. Any restrictions on hate speech should not be misused to silence minorities and to suppress criticism of official policies, political opposition or religious beliefs. In many instances, ECRI has found that an effective approach to tackling hate speech, in particular cyberhate, is self-regulation by public and private institutions, media and the Internet industry, such as the adoption of codes of conduct accompanied by sanctions for non-compliance. Education and counter-speech are also equally important in fighting the misconceptions and misinformation that form the basis of hate speech. Therefore, ECRI considers that effective action against the use of hate speech requires raising public awareness of the importance of respecting pluralism and of the dangers posed by hate speech. Underreporting of hate speech and hate-motivated violence is another unfortunate feature of these two phenomena. Victims rarely report incidents to the authorities for fear of retaliation or of not being taken seriously, or because they have no confidence in the justice system. This contributes to lack data which makes it difficult to quantify the extent of the problem and take effective measures to address it. ECRI recommends states to provide practical support to those targeted by hate speech and violence: they should be made aware of their rights to redress through administrative, civil and criminal proceedings and encouraged to report to the authorities, and receive legal and psychological assistance.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d13\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://geneva.usmission.gov/2012/08/27/curtailing-freedom-of-expression-is-not-the-way-to-combat-hateful-speech/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Curtailing Freedom of Expression is not the Way to Combat Hateful ... The progress we have made, we have accomplished without banning speech or restricting freedom of expression. In light of this framework, the United States has long made clear its concerns over resorting to restrictions on freedom of expression, association, and assembly[1] in order to promote tolerance and respect. This concern includes the restrictions contained in Article 4 of the CERD to the extent that they might be interpreted as allowing or requiring restrictions on forms of expression that do not constitute incitement to imminent violence or acts of intimidation. Indeed, these concerns were so fundamental that the United States took a reservation, when it became a Party to the CERD, noting it would not accept any obligation that could limit the extensive protections for such fundamental freedoms guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution.[2] Banning and punishing offensive and hateful speech is neither an effective approach to combating such intolerance, nor an appropriate role for government in seeking to promote respect for diversity. As President Obama stated in a speech delivered in Cairo, Egypt in June 2009, suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away. In fact to do so can be counterproductive and even raise the profile of such ideas. We believe the best antidote to offensive and hateful speech is constructive dialogue that counters and responds to such speech by refuting it through principled arguments, causing the hateful speech to fall under its own weight. In addition, we believe government should speak out against such offensive speech, and employ tools to address intolerance that include a combination of robust legal protections against discrimination and hate crimes, proactive government outreach, education, and the vigorous defense of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including freedom of expression. Accordingly, the United States has a strong interest in the subject of this hearing and shares the following views in the hopes that they will help shed light on the need to promote respect for broad protections for freedoms of expression in the ongoing global struggle to combat racial discrimination.

But the categories are much narrower than Austin’s performative utterances (Greenawalt 1989, 58). This is particularly evident in relation to the treatment of performatives in Austin’s later lectures: once the dichotomy of performatives and descriptive statements is abandoned, there is an enormous family of related ‘speech-acts’ – utterances with both locutionary content and illocutionary force – which contain an immense range of expression (Austin 1975, Lecture XII, esp. 150). Greenawalt was concerned to elucidate the appropriate constitutional and legal approaches to the understanding of language rather than the purely philosophical questions canvassed by Austin. The practical consequences of their different approaches can be teased out in the context of hate speech; in particular it can be asked how far the freedom of speech principle applies to extreme racist and other hate speech, or whether such speech falls outside the scope of the principle as might be the case if its dissemination constitutes harm. For Greenawalt hate speech is clearly covered by a free speech principle or constitutional clause, as is political speech generally; racist speech reveals the speaker’s beliefs, and may even provide information about the world, though it will generally consist of bogus claims, as in the case of Holocaust denial. In his view (Greenawalt 1989, 300–301) that was what happened in the Beauharnais group libel case where a racist pamphlet had made highly provocative claims about the incidence of Black crime in Chicago: it was wrong for the Supreme Court to have ruled the speech outside the scope of the First Amendment.

The United Nations and other international bodies emphasize that addressing hate speech should not mean limiting free expression, though incitement to violence or discrimination is prohibited under international law [d1][d12].

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

F or the second year in a row on Forbes’ list of the World’s Billionaires, the planet’s richest woman is L’Oréal heiress Françoise Bettencourt Meyers of France. Worth an estimated $74.8 billion, Bettencourt Meyers is an estimated $1.2 billion richer than a year ago, making her the fourteenth richest person in the world. The 68-year-old French citizen is the vice chair of the board of L’Oréal, the world’s largest cosmetics and beauty company, which her chemist grandfather Eugène Paul Louis Schueller founded in 1909. Bettencourt Meyers first landed on Forbes' billionaires list in 2018, after her mother, Liliane Bettencourt–then the planet’s richest woman–died in 2017 at the age of 94. In 2007, Bettencourt Meyers famously sued François-Marie Banier, a close friend of her mother’s, for allegedly siphoning more than $1 billion worth of gifts from the elderly woman. Banier was later sentenced to three years in jail and was ordered to reportedly pay back $16.5 million to Bettencourt and her family. Bettencourt Meyers and her family own about 33% of L’Oréal’s stock. She has been a member of the company’s board since 1997. Her two sons, Jean-Victor Meyers and Nicolas Meyers, also sit on the board. As the world’s largest beauty manufacturer, L’Oréal owns more than 35 cosmetic, skincare and personal-care brands. Its lead portfolio companies include Maybelline, Garnier and NYX. Far from a stodgy conglomerate, the 100-year-old company has continued to stay fresh-faced via technology and acquisitions. It recently launched a headset to help people make precise fragrance choices.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2022-04-07\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-47824937\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Who are the world's richest women? - BBC Ms Bezos, who was born MacKenzie Tuttle, also ...

As well as a fortune of more than $100 billion, the heir to the L’Oréal fortune enjoys the most priceless possession of the ultra-rich: anonymity It is often said that after a certain level, money is always a problem. Liliane Bettencourt, who knew something about fortunes — as the heiress to the cosmetics giant L’Oréal, she was for years the richest woman in France, with an estimated capital of €31.2 billion (approximately $35 billion) — once confirmed that “once you reach a certain amount of money, people lose their minds.” Her only daughter, Françoise, has spent a lifetime being discreet about her wealth. “Indeed, money does drive people crazy,” she declared in a single interview she gave to Le Monde in 2012. Born in 1953, Françoise Bettencourt Meyers has always transcended the cliché of the millionaire heiress. On December 28, 2023, she officially became the richest woman in the world, as well as the first to break through the $100 billion barrier thanks to the rise in the company’s shares, according to Bloomberg. “Again, I know that I’m privileged but, as you can see, I don’t live in a mansion. We are not big art collectors and, as you can see, I don’t wear jewelry,” she said when she received Le M Magazine, from the newspaper Le Monde, at her home. Bettencourt Meyers lives in a modern, contemporary two-story building with large windows; a relatively modest dwelling compared to the mansion where her parents lived in the heart of the Parisian neighborhood of Saint James, in the exclusive commune of Neuilly-sur-Seine. Her mother was the daughter of Eugène Schueller, who founded L’Oréal in 1909 after discovering an innovative hair dye. Her father, André Bettencourt, was a minister during the presidency of Charles de Gaulle in the 1960s and 1970s.

Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Knowing the specific age of consent in each state can help you better understand legal boundaries and protections. What is the Age of Consent? The age of consent defines the age at which an individual is legally permitted to consent to sexual activity. This age varies by state, with most states setting the age between 16 and 18. Federal law also plays a role, especially in cases involving interstate activities, online communication, or other federal offenses involving minors. Generally, federal law prohibits sexual activity with individuals under 18 in these cases, even if the age of consent is lower in the minor’s state.

Age of consent laws are designed to protect young people from sexual exploitation. These laws acknowledge that minors may lack the emotional maturity or legal standing to make informed decisions regarding sexual activity. By setting a legal age, states can help protect minors from predatory actions by older individuals. However, there are also challenges, as many states do not make allowances for minors who misrepresent or lie about their age. Ignorance of a minor’s age is typically not a defense in cases involving statutory offenses.

California Consent Laws California's age of consent laws essentially prohibit a minor from engaging in sexual acts consensually, even if they are willing participants. Until an individual reaches the age of 18 in California, they are not legally considered capable of providing their own consent. If an adult engages in sexual acts with a minor, they could be charged with statutory rape—which is a criminal offense that carries stiff legal penalties. However, the severity of the charges will depend on the age of the victim and the perpetrator. Possible Penalties Include: If the perpetrator is no more than three years older than the victim, they will be charged with a misdemeanor. If the perpetrator is more than three years older than the victim, they could be charged with a misdemeanor or felony. If the perpetrator is 21 or older, and the victim is under the age of 16, they could face enhanced sentencing. Misdemeanor penalties may include up to one year in jail and $1,000 in fines. Felony penalties may include up to four years in prison and $10,000 in fines.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/age-of-consent-by-country\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Age of Consent by Country 2024 - World Population Review Most countries require young people to be at least 14 before having sex.

Angola and the Philippines both set the age of consent at 12, which is the lowest in the world. Several other countries, including Niger and Japan, have designated 13 as the age of consent—although Japan has notoriously inconsistent consent laws that designate different ages of consent, ranging from 13 to 20, depending upon where one is in the country. Additionally, several countries in Asia and Africa require individuals to be married before they can legally have sex. These include Libya, Afghanistan, and Saudi Arabia, all of which are highly conservative on issues of gender and sexuality. Many countries, states, or territories also have \\\"close-in-age\\\" exemptions, commonly called \\\"Romeo and Juliet\\\" clauses. These laws can remove legal liability when all participants in a sex act are underaged (for example, two 16-year-olds). In areas that do not have close-in-age exemptions, it is possible for a person who is under the age of consent to be held liable for engaging in sexual activity with another underaged person. For example: If a country has no Romeo and Juliet clause and its age of consent of 16, two 15-year-olds who willingly have sex with one another could both be prosecuted for statutory rape. While most European countries set 16-17 as the age of consent, several others, including Malta and Vatican City, require young people to be at least 18 before legally having sex.

The “Marriage Exception” Believe it or not, there is one exception to California’s strict age of consent rule, and it’s quite ironic. Per Penal Code 261.5, engaging in sex with a minor is considered statutory rape unless the two individuals are legally married. California law does not set a minimum age for marriage, meaning it’s legal to marry a minor as long as the parents consent and there’s a corresponding court order. Sex within that marital relationship is not considered a crime, even if one or both spouses are below the age of consent. This exception may seem bizarre, but it’s essential to know for those navigating the complexities of California’s age of consent laws. Age of Consent Vs.

Sexual relations with an individual under the state's mandated age of consent is deemed as statutory rape, since rape is generally defined as sex without the other's consent, and anyone under the age of consent does not have the ability to consent in the eyes of the law. This is true in some jurisdictions, even if both partners are themselves younger than the age of consent, and both parties could technically be prosecuted. Every U.S. also sets a minimum age for marriage to prevent child marriage. Penalties One or more charges may be used to prosecute violations of a state's age of consent laws, such as statutory rape or the state's equivalent of that charge. The severity of the criminal charge (e.g., Class A felony, Class B felony, misdemeanor, etc.) depends on the specific acts committed and the relative ages of the perpetrator and victim. Those found guilty face fines and jail time, as much as $25,000 and fifty years in prison, depending on the state. Age of Consent Range in the United States The states' laws differ, and the minimum age of consent in the United States is 16, and the maximum is 18 years old. From time to time, states do update their laws, including the age of consent. For example, from 2018 to 2019, Wyoming and New Mexico raised their age of consent from 16 to 17. In some states, there is a close-in-age exemption. Some states stipulate this to allow an exception when consensual sex involves an individual, or individuals underage and the partners are close in age. This age-dependent exemption is also known as the \\\"Romeo and Juliet law\\\" and is designed to prevent the prosecution of underage couples who engage in consensual sex when: both participants are close-in-age and one or both are below the age of consent.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  }\n]\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"As of August 1, 2018, the youngest age of consent in U.S. states is 16 years old.\",\n    \"quote\": \"As of August 1, 2018, the age of consent in each state in the United States is either 16 years of age, 17 years of age, or 18 years of age.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"Explicitly states that the lowest age of consent among U.S. states is 16, directly answering the query.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"high\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"The age of consent in the United States typically ranges from 16 to 18 years old, making 16 the youngest age of consent.\",\n    \"quote\": \"This age varies from state to state across the United States, typically ranging from 16 to 18 years old.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The snippet explicitly states the range of ages of consent, identifying 16 as the lowest, which directly answers the query.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"low\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"verdict\": \"partially supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"The legal age of consent in California is 18 years old.\",\n    \"quote\": \"The legal age of consent in California is 18 years old.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"Provides the age of consent for California only, not the youngest age overall, so it partially answers the query.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"low\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"Angola and the Philippines have the lowest age of consent in the world, set at 12.\",\n    \"quote\": \"Angola and the Philippines both set the age of consent at 12, which is the lowest in the world.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"Explicitly states that 12 is the lowest age of consent worldwide, directly answering the query.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"low\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d5\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"In North America, the age of consent can be as low as 12 in some Mexican states and 13 in some U.S. states.\",\n    \"quote\": \"In a number of U.S. states, the age of consent can drop to as low as 13...

Some documents note that certain jurisdictions, such as California, set higher ages like 18 [d3][d6], while others extend the discussion globally, identifying countries such as Angola and the Philippines with ages as low as 12 [d4][d5]. Historically, Delaware once had an age of consent as low as 7, but this is no longer current [d8].\n[[END-OF-ANSWER]]"}]}

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Mike Watson Images/Thinkstock Humans have a special relationship with house pets, and a full 62 percent claim that their pets understand the words that they speak [source: USA Today]. While there's no way to know exactly how much Fido gets what you're saying, scientists have proven that some dogs, apes and even dolphins can understand spoken language. In one study, a border collie named Rico demonstrated that he knew the name of more than 200 objects, and could fetch these items on command [source: Science]. A similar study conducted on another border collie named Chaser went even further; not only could Chaser distinguish the names of at least 1,022 objects, he could also infer the names of new objects [source: Hecht]. For example, if asked to fetch Mr. Monkey -- a toy he had never seen before -- he could locate Mr. Monkey through the process of elimination when the monkey was placed near toys he was familiar with. Advertisement Perhaps even more exciting, Chaser was able to repeat this process of locating unfamiliar toys by name a full month later, after only being exposed to the new items once before. He was also able to understand verbs and objects used in different contexts; for example, Chaser demonstrated that he could put his nose to a ball, fetch, touch or take the ball depending on the command given. Just so you don't think that border collies have an edge, a Yorkshire terrier demonstrated his understanding of more than 120 words in a separate study [source: Hecht]. But what about other animals who don't have such a close relationship with humans? Consider the case of Kanzi, a bonobo ape. Through years of work with his trainer, Kanzi was able to demonstrate his understanding of more than 3,000 English words [source: Raffaele]. A researcher would speak the words from a separate room to avoid giving any contextual clues, and Kanzi would listen through headphones and point to the symbol represented by the word on his special keyboard.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://wonderopolis.org/wonder/which-animals-understand-humans-best\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Which Animals Understand Humans Best? | Wonderopolis Today’s Wonder of the Day was inspired by jackson. jackson Wonders, “How do dogs understand human commands?” Thanks for WONDERing with us, jackson! Have you ever had a chat with an animal? Many pet owners talk to their animals. How much do the pets really understand? There’s not much evidence that our fish or lizard pets understand us. However, dogsrespond when we say, “Sit,” or “Stay.” A 2016 study showed that dogs really do understand human speech. This isn’t unique to our canine friends! Potbelly pigs, chimpanzees, and elephants all understand some human language. Scientists believe we may even be able to talk to dolphins one day! Some animals are very good at communication. They understand humans better than other animals do. A grey parrot named Alex knew 150 words and spoke in full sentences. Chaser, a border collie in South Carolina, knows all the names of her 1,022 toys. She’ll fetch whichever one you ask her to! The most famous example is Koko, a western lowland gorilla who knew sign language. Koko was born at the San Francisco Zoo on the 4th of July in 1971. The zoo named her Hanabiko, which is Japanese for “fireworks child.” Her caretakers called her “Koko” for short. Koko began learning American Sign Language after her first birthday from a psychologist named Francine “Penny” Patterson. With Patterson’s help, Koko learned 2,000 words! Koko was very friendly. She enjoyed talking with most humans. Everyone who met her could tell she was smart. What really set Koko apart, though, was her personality. Koko didn’t just communicate her needs — she also told jokes and played tricks on her trainers. Koko even insulted people she didn’t like by calling them words like “devil” and “dirty toilet.” That wasn‘t very nice! Luckily, Koko liked most of the people she met. It didn’t take long for Koko to gain globalfame. She even became friends with several celebrities.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93animal_communication\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Human–animal communication - Wikipedia Human–animal communication is the communication observed between humans and other animals, ranging from non-verbal cues and vocalizations to the use of language. Some human–animal communication may be observed in casual circumstances, such as the interactions between pets and their owners, which can reflect a form of spoken, while not necessarily verbal dialogue. A dog being scolded is able to grasp the message by interpreting cues such as the owner's stance, tone of voice, and body language. This communication is two-way, as owners can learn to discern the subtle differences between barks or meows, and there is a clear difference between the bark of an angry dog defending its home and the happy bark of the same animal while playing. Communication (often nonverbal) is also significant in equestrian activities such as dressage. One scientific study has found that 30 bird species and 29 mammal species share the same pattern of pitch and speed in basic messages. Therefore, humans and those 59 species can understand each other when they express \\\"aggression, hostility, appeasement, approachability, submission and fear. \\\"[1][2] Parrots are able to use words meaningfully in linguistic tasks.[3] In particular, the grey parrotAlex learned one hundred words,[4] and after training used English words to answer questions about color, shapes, size and numbers correctly about 80% of the time.[5] He also wanted to try to go without training, said where he wanted to be taken, such as his cage or the back of a chair, and protested when taken elsewhere, or when hidden objects were not where he thought they were.[6] He asked a question, what color he himself was,[6] which has been called the only question so far asked by a non-human animal.[7]Scientific American editor Madhusree Mukerjee described these abilities as creativity and reasoning comparable to nonhuman primates or cetaceans,[8] while expressing concern that extensive language use resulted in feather-plucking behavior, a possible sign of stress.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/features/7-super-smart-animals-that-have-something-to-say\",\n    \"snippet\": \"7 super smart animals that will amaze you | Nature of Things Sea Lions If understanding language is the first step to speaking it, then Rio the Californian sea lion is well on her way to becoming a sea-dwelling linguist. Born in a marine lab in California in 1985, Rio was raised by a surrogate human mother and has been impressing researchers for decades as the first non-human to demonstrate “equivalence classification” — that is, logical thinking. Rio recognizes numbers and knows the entire alphabet, having figured out early on that if A and B are grouped together and B and C are too, then C also belongs with A. Elephants Humans are very familiar with the importance of communication in forming lasting social bonds, and it appears elephants may have the same idea. Koshik, a male Asian elephant living in captivity in South Korea, has perfected his impression of each of his trainers, right down to the pitch and timbre — and while he’s not actually speaking Korean, it sure sounds like it. What’s even more remarkable is that elephants don’t have vocal tracts like ours, so Koshik creates the sounds by inserting his trunk into his mouth. Dogs While dogs don’t have the vocal ability to “speak” to us, they do have the cognitive power to process what we say to them. Boasting the largest vocabulary of any non-human animal, Chaser the Border Collie knows the names of 1,022 different items, including 800 cloth animals and 26 Frisbees. A new study has shown that dogs, as well as many other species, have the ability to process and understand words. But what sets us apart as humans is our invention of the words themselves.

Do you sound like Charlie Brownâs teacherâjust a series of âwah wah wahsââor does your dog genuinely understand your words? Are dogs on the same page as us, or even in the same book? This article will explore dogs and their understanding of human language. Some dogs like Chaser (the dog who knows 1,000+ words) are celebrated for their panache for human language. The news media hails them as âsuper smart,â and after meeting Chaser, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson exclaimed, âWho would have thought that animals are capable of this much display of intellect?â So, what are these dogs doing with words? Letâs look at the types of words that dogs understand. Objects Dogs can learn the names of many, many, many different objects. Julia Fischer, group leader at the German Primate Centerâs Cognitive Ethology Lab, heard that a Border Collie named Rico knew the names of 70 individual objects, and she wanted to know how Rico mapped specific human words to particular objects. âI contacted the owners, and they let us visit their home and start a study of Rico,â explains Fischer. This culminated in 2004 with an article in Science, reporting that Rico knew the names of over 200 different objects. Seven years later, Chaser, a Border Collie in South Carolina, took the gold medal when Alliston Reid and John Pilley of Wofford College reported that Chaser knew the distinct names of 1,022 objects â more than 800 cloth animals, 116 balls, 26 Frisbees, and 100 plastic items.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Similar occurrences are also found in the northwest of Mexico and El Salvador in Central America.[2] In South America escapees are only reported from Ecuador and the northeast of Argentina.[2] Cultivation History Which peaches might be wild type or feral escapes from cultivation is still an open scientific question.[15] The authors of the Flora of China wrote in 2003 that completely wild peach trees no longer exist and this view is widely accepted.[13][33] Although its botanical name Prunus persica refers to Persia peaches originated in China,[50] where they have been cultivated since the Neolithic period.[51] From the 1980s to the 2010s it was believed that cultivation started around 2000 BCE.[52][53] In 2014 new research was published showing that domestication occurred as early as 6000 BCE in Zhejiang Province on the central east coast of China. The oldest archaeological peach stones are from the Kuahuqiao site near Hangzhou. Archaeologists point to the Yangtze River Valley as the place where the early selection for favorable peach varieties probably took place.[54] A domesticated peach appeared very early in Japan, in 4700–4400 BCE, during the Jōmon period. It was already similar to modern cultivated forms, where the peach stones are significantly larger and more compressed than earlier stones. This domesticated type of peach was brought into Japan from China. Nevertheless, in China itself, this variety is currently attested only at a later date around 3300 to 2300 BCE.[55] It is also found elsewhere in West Asia in ancient times.[57]\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.froghollow.com/blogs/news/the-history-of-peaches-frog-hollow-farm-1?srsltid=AfmBOooyFNwz2r-OUQ5Ac6SDlzk4frH1FiIIjRL0dyipkwa7eoXf8qke\",\n    \"snippet\": \"The History of Peaches | Frog Hollow Farm Peaches originated in China, where they are native to northwest China.

The History of Peaches | Frog Hollow Farm | Where Did Peaches Come From Frog Hollow Farm I am currently reading a book called the \\\"Golden Peaches of Samarkand\\\", by Edward K Schafer, all about the historical importance of peaches, specifically in the T'ang Empire in China. The information is vast, but I thought I'd share with you some tidbits about the history of everyone's favorite stone fruit- the PEACH. Peaches originated in China, where they are native to northwest China. Archaeologists believe that peaches in China were first domesticated along the Yangzi River, where they have found fossilized peach stones believed to be from 6000 BC. Historians have found peaches discussed in Chinese writings from the 10th century. Of specific importance to Chinese culture was the peach blossom, thought to fend off evil spirits and provide vitality. When traveling between towns, Emperors were preceded by soldiers carrying peach blossoms, and each New Year began with peach blossoms hung on front doors all over the county. To this day, China is the world's leading peach producer. China produces half of the world's peaches - 11 million tons of peaches per year, followed by Italy producing 1.5 tons, and then the USA at 1 ton. The botanical name for peach is \\\"Prunus persica\\\", translated from Latin to \\\"Present from Persia\\\", referring to the Persian introduction of the Peach to the Romans. After conquering Persia, Alexander the Great took peach seeds to Europe, marking the introduction of the fruits to Spain and France. In the 16th century, Spanish explorers brought the first peaches to South America; from there, the peach traveled to England, where it became a rare and prized delicacy. It was known that Queen Victoria's favorite treat was a fresh peach after dinner.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2017-04-27\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.quora.com/Where-did-white-peaches-come-from\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Where did white peaches come from? - Quora Peaches came originally from China and the white fleshed peaches are the most popular ones in China today but they have been around as long as ...\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2021-07-24\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.seriouseats.com/where-do-the-best-peaches-come\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Where Do the Best Peaches Come From? - Serious Eats The best peaches come from sunny California. Some would say they come from Frog Hollow in Brentwood, and farmer Al Corchesne grows a mighty fine peach. I have been on a lifelong search for the perfect peach, one that's so juicy you end up wearing it, one that has a perfect balance between sweetness and acidity. You might think that those of us who celebrate local food would pronounce the peach grown in our backyard the best, but I live in New York City, where there are precious few backyards. But I cannot say in good conscience and all honesty that the peaches grown in neighboring backyards and farms all over New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania are the best, either. I certainly eat more than my fair share of local farmers' market peaches from Nemeth Orchards and Stone Arch Farms, but their peaches are not life-changing affairs. I have friends from Georgia who claim that the best peaches are grown there (yes, I know that baseball Hall of Famer Ty Cobb was nicknamed the Georgia Peach), but I have tasted many Georgia peaches, and though they can be pretty damn fine, they are not the best. Others say that the best peaches come from South Carolina or Texas or Colorado. They would be wrong as well. No, I'm afraid I can say with more than a modicum of certainty that the best peaches come from sunny California. Some would say they come from Frog Hollow in Brentwood, and farmer Al Corchesne grows a mighty fine peach. But the best peaches I have ever put in my mouth come from Goldbud Farms in Placerville, in the middle of California Gold Rush country, and from Honey Crisp Farms in Reedley, just outside Fresno. I recently found Honey Crisp peaches at a new farmstand on Martha's Vineyard, and at $6.98 a pound, they were a stone cold bargain. Goldbud's Ron Mansfield and Honey Crisp's Art Lange both have degrees in peachology from the University of California. They employ sophisticated growing and irrigation methods to grow peaches that will make you think you're tasting one for the first time. And isn't that how you want to feel when you bite into a peach?

But despite its associations with perfectly pink-orange peaches, \\\"The Peach State\\\" of Georgia is neither the biggest peach producing state (that honor goes to California) nor are peaches its biggest crop. So why is it that Georgia peaches are so iconic? The answer, like so much of Southern history, has a lot to do with slavery — specifically, its end and a need for the South to rebrand itself. Yet, as historian William Thomas Okie writes in his book The Georgia Peach, the fruit may be sweet but the industry in the South was formed on the same culture of white supremacy as cotton and other slave-tended crops. Sponsor Message Peaches, which are native to Asia, have been growing haphazardly in the United States since they were brought over by Europeans in the 17th century. But it wasn't until the latter half of the 1800s that aspiring horticulturists began to try and grow the peach as an orchard crop. In 1856, a Belgian father-and-son pair, Louis and Prosper Berckmans, purchased a plot of orchard land in Augusta, Ga., that would come to be known as Fruitland. Their intention was to demonstrate that fruit and ornamental plants could become just as important an industry in the South as cotton, which was ruining the soil with its intensive planting. Buy Featured Book Horticulture slowly became accepted as a gentleman's pursuit. But it wasn't until the end of the Civil War and the abolishment of slavery that the sudden availability of labor gave peaches the perfect opening. After the war, \\\"fruit growing, which to the cotton planter was a secondary matter, [became] one of great solicitude to the farmer,\\\" Prosper Berckmans wrote in 1876.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2017-07-21\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d7\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.fishersorchard.com/about-peaches\",\n    \"snippet\": \"All About Peaches — Fishers Orchard Fishers means peaches.

All About Peaches Fishers means peaches It is said that the peach originated in China, but for many people in the Upstate, peaches mean Fishers. We’ve been growing peaches since 1930, so we know a thing or two about what it takes to produce a juicy, sweet, mouth-watering peach or nectarine. Fishers Orchard sells approximately 50 different peach varieties, as well as nectarines and plums, at its three Greer locations. Fresh peaches are generally available from June until September, but that can vary based on growing conditions. Did you know? South Carolina has a long, storied history with the peach. According to historical records, peaches were found in South Carolina as far back as the late 1600s. Since then, a lot has changed, but South Carolina. Today, South Carolina produces the most peaches of any state in the South. Our state ships about 90,000 tons a year compared with Georgia’s 40,000 tons, according to United States Department of Agriculture statistics. Nationwide, the top four states in peach production are California, South Carolina, Georgia and New Jersey. California is a significant producer of both fresh and processed peaches, while South Carolina and Georgia mainly produce fresh peaches. Other interesting facts: There are about 18,000 acres of peach orchards in South Carolina. More than 200 million pounds of peaches are harvested in South Carolina in a typical year. South Carolina has been called “The tastier peach state.” Weather is the most important factor in growing peaches. A 1- or 2-degree drop at a critical time can make or break a peach crop. Peaches are rich sources of vitamins A and C as well as alpha hydroxy fruit acids. How to select the best peaches A key thing to remember is that Fishers Orchard peaches are picked at the peak of their sweetness, so they are ready to eat. They won’t become sweeter as they sit around and soften. Additionally: Select peaches with a creamy or yellow color; they tend to be the sweetest.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d8\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://lanesouthernorchards.com/blogs/news/9-fun-facts-about-peaches?srsltid=AfmBOorFQ8471rJf9d1n8CjCtHaEhV6C7Lfp8SuYU1oLSuXiRG2mBOV4\",\n    \"snippet\": \"9 Fun Facts About Peaches - Lane Southern Orchards Peaches Originated in China. A lesser-known fun fact about peaches is they are one of the most ancient domesticated fruits, with their origins ... With yellow and white flesh options as well as clingstone and freestone options, nectarines offer a similar flavor with smoother skin. 3. Only One Gene Separates Peaches and Nectarines Another interesting peach fact is peaches and apricots are only separated by one gene. The mutation causes apricots to have smooth skin instead of peaches' distinct fuzzy texture. Nectarines sometimes appear to have a deeper red color than peaches, which is most likely due to the lack of fuzz that allows the color to come through more. Regardless, other than the one differing recessive gene, peaches and nectarines are genetically identical. Nectarines can even be found growing on the same tree as peaches. 4. Georgia Is Known as the \\\"Peach State\\\" When you think of Georgia, you may also think of peaches. But do you know why? While other states, such as California and South Carolina, also grow peaches, Georgia produces the most high-quality and delicious peaches. Georgia's location and weather provide optimal peach growing conditions by being far north enough to provide enough winter chill but south enough to ensure harvesting can happen on schedule. Peaches are now recognized as the state fruit of Georgia. 5. Peaches Originated in China A lesser-known fun fact about peaches is they are one of the most ancient domesticated fruits, with theirorigins leading back to China. Peaches are considered very important in Chinese culture as they symbolize fertility and longevity, and the fruit is mentioned throughout Chinese mythology. Peach seeds are easy to preserve and transport, which made them a popular item for trading along the Silk Road. Eventually, peaches made their way to America once Spanish conquistadors introduced peaches to North America during the mid-1500s. Peach trees quickly sprouted in Virginia, Georgia and the Carolinas. 6. There Are Three Categories of Peaches Peaches are considered a stone fruit because of the hard pit located in the peach's center. The stone or pit and its relationship to the sweet fruity flesh surrounding it determine how peaches are categorized.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2023-03-15\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d9\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.britannica.com/plant/peach\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Peach | Fruit, Description, History, Cultivation, Uses, & Facts The peach probably originated in China and then spread westward through Asia to the Mediterranean countries and later to other parts of Europe. The peach fruit develops from a single ovary that ripens into both a fleshy juicy exterior that forms the edible part of the fruit and a hard interior, called the stone or pit, that encloses the seed(s). Of the two ovules in the ovary, usually only one becomes fertilized and develops into a seed. This frequently results in one half of the fruit being slightly larger than the other. The flesh may be white, yellow, or red. Varieties may be freestone types, which have stones that separate easily from the ripe flesh, or clingstones, which have flesh that adheres firmly to the stone. The skin of most ripe peaches is downy or fuzzy; peaches with smooth skins are called nectarines. Most peach varieties produce more fruits than can be maintained and developed to full size. Some shedding of fruitlets takes place naturally, about a month to six weeks after full bloom, but the number remaining may have to be reduced further by hand thinning. History and cultivation The peach probably originated in China and then spread westward through Asia to the Mediterranean countries and later to other parts of Europe. The Spanish explorers took the peach to the New World, and as early as 1600 the fruit was found in Mexico. For centuries the cultivation and selection of new varieties of peaches were largely confined to the gardens of the nobility, and large-scale commercial peach growing did not begin until the 19th century, in the United States. The early plantings were seedling peaches, inevitably variable and often of poor quality. The practice of grafting superior strains onto hardy seedling rootstocks, which came later in the century, led to the development of large commercial orchards. Worldwide, the peach is one of the most important deciduous-tree fruits, and China, Italy, Spain, and the United States are major producers. Peach trees are relatively short-lived as compared with some other fruit trees.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2025-01-03\"\n  }\n]\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"Peaches originated in China, where they were first domesticated and cultivated.\",\n    \"quote\": \"The peach (Prunus persica) is a deciduous tree first domesticated and cultivated in China.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The snippet directly states that peaches were first domesticated and cultivated in China, fully answering the query about their origin.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"high\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"Peaches originated in China, specifically in the northwest region.\",\n    \"quote\": \"Peaches originated in China, where they are native to northwest China.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The snippet directly states that peaches originated in China, fully answering the query.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"low\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"Peaches originally came from China.\",\n    \"quote\": \"Peaches came originally from China and the white fleshed peaches are the most popular ones in China today\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The snippet explicitly states that peaches came originally from China, directly answering the query about their origin.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"low\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"The snippet states that the best peaches come from sunny California.\",\n    \"quote\": \"The best peaches come from sunny California.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"Directly answers the query by identifying California as the origin of peaches.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"low\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d5\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"Peaches originated in Asia, where they have been grown for more than two thousand years.\",\n    \"quote\": \"Peaches have been grown in Asia for more than two thousand years, and produced for centuries in the United States.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The snippet explicitly states that peaches have been grown in Asia for over two thousand years, directly answering their origin.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"high\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d6\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"Peaches originated in Asia and were brought to the United States by Europeans in the 17th century.\",\n    \"quote\": \"Peaches, which are native to Asia, have been growing haphazardly in the United States since they were brought over by Europeans in the 17th\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The snippet explicitly states that peaches are native to Asia, directly answering the query about their origin.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"high\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d7\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"The snippet states that the peach originated in China.\",\n    \"quote\": \"It is said that the peach originated in China, but for many people in the Upstate, peaches mean Fishers.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"Directly states the origin of peaches as China, fully answering the query.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"low\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d8\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"Peaches originated in China.\",\n    \"quote\": \"Peaches Originated in China.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Still to be re-recorded are Taylor Swift, and Reputation. As Taylor has literally only just released the re-recording of 1989 (Taylor's Version), it might be a while before we get either of the next two re-recordings. Why is Taylor Swift re-recording her albums? As any Swiftie will know, in the last few years Taylor has been busy rerecording her own version of earlier albums. But why exactly? Well when she was starting out in her career at 15 years old she was signed onto the record label Big Machine Records, which owned the rights to her masters aka original recordings. In 2018, after her contract with Big Machine Records ended, Taylor signed onto a new label Universal's Republic Records, and as part of the deal she owns the right to her masters.

Why Is Taylor Swift Rerecording Her Albums? Taylor Swift began rerecording her albums in 2021, two years after Braun purchased Scott Borchetta’s Big Machine Records, Swift’s original label. Swift had already left the label for Republic Records and, according to her 2019 Tumblr post, had begged Borchetta to let her buy back her work. He instead told her she could continue to record albums for Big Machine and “earn” her songs back. She refused, and when Borchetta sold, it was to a man Swift said had bullied and gaslighted her for years, partly through his client, West, whom Swift accused of making “a revenge porn music video which strips my body naked.” The rereleases include new songs she wrote for the albums but didn’t include on the original versions, dubbed “From the Vault” releases. Swift plans to rerecord two more of her original albums, Taylor Swift and Reputation, the first and last albums Braun owns, but has not said when those will be released.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-01-08\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_by_Taylor_Swift\",\n    \"snippet\": \"List of songs by Taylor Swift - Wikipedia In 2020, Swift signed a new publishing deal with Universal Music Publishing Group and released two albums, Folklore and Evermore, which incorporates indie folk.

Therefore, Lover, Folklore, Evermore, Midnights, and The Tortured Poets Department were all made with Swift being fully in control of the rights and production, and her Taylor's Version albums are quickly reclaiming the past as well. Considering how quickly she has turned out her re-releases, it can be assumed that Swifties won't have to wait long until one of her other classic albums gets a modern redo. The only albums left that still need to get a Taylor's Version are Swift's debut album and Reputation. Fans have long theorized that Swift's debut album would be the final Taylor's Version to be released. Leaving these two albums for last has indicated that Swift will reclaim her reputation and her own name in the same way she has all of her music. It's likely that the albums will get their Taylor's Versions after Taylor Swift finishes her Eras Tour in late 2024.

Fans were quick to note that “The Tortured Poets Department” is the longest title for a Taylor Swift album by a large margin, a distinction previously held by her third album, “Speak Now.” Before “TTPD,” “Speak Now” was her only album title consisting of more than one word. Speculation surrounding the new album and its uncharacteristic title has primarily revolved around Swift’s 2023 breakup with British actor Joe Alwyn after their six-year relationship. After the album announcement, a 2022 Variety interview between Alwyn and Paul Mescal resurfaced on X. The pair revealed in the interview that they were both members of a WhatsApp group chat titled “The Tortured Man Club,” prompting some fans to draw parallels between Alwyn and Swift’s upcoming album. The true meaning of “The Tortured Poets Department” remains to be seen, but the rollout of the album has featured references to famous poems like Charles Baudelaire's “The Albatross,” among other literary references. When can fans expect a new music video? The announcement in the timetable was accompanied by 14 tally marks, leading some sleuthing Swifties to theorize that the video could be for the album’s first track, “Fortnight (ft.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only.

All Studio Ghibli Movies In Order of Release Date (Including The Boy and the Heron) Summary The studio is famous for award-winning movies like Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, and The Tale of Princess Kaguya. Some less-known but equally powerful movies, like Grave of the Fireflies, showcase Ghibli's versatile storytelling range. Everyone with even a casual awareness of anime knows Studio Ghibli, Hayao Miyazaki's animation studio responsible for some of the greatest anime films in the last 40 years. Ghibli is often compared to Disney, in that many of their films are very family-friendly, and lighter, softer affairs overall than many other well-known anime movies. That's not exclusively true, as will soon become apparent, but the studio has had a long life in the industry, producing many different kinds of fantastical stories that are now considered beloved classics. Studio Ghibli got their start in 1985, although many of the key players, like Miyazaki, were already working together even a bit before that. Ghibli films are some of the only anime movies to get respect when it comes to awards, with Spirited Away even earning the studio an Oscar for best animated feature. Ghibli's work has received high praise from fans and critics from the very beginning, though, and that will become clear in this list. 1 Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1984) Directed by: Hayao Miyazaki Nausicaä was directed and written by Hayao Miyazaki, but it was technically just before Studio Ghibli was founded in 1985. Nausicaä was released and distributed by Ghibli, though, so it definitely counts. Nausicaä tells the tale of the eponymous Nausicaä, a princess of the Valley of the Wind who strives for a way for humans and creatures to coexist in the post-apocalyptic world in which the story is set. When a long-lost weapon reappears in her territory, Nausicaä must stop the militaristic forces from reclaiming it, lest the tragedy that destroyed the world happen again.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-09\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://ghiblicollection.com/pages/filmography\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Filmography – The Studio Ghibli Collection Overflowing with imaginative creatures and thrilling storytelling, Spirited Away became a worldwide smash hit, and is one of the most critically-acclaimed films ...

Miyazaki's final film before his supposed retirement, “The Boy and the Heron,” released without a trailer, only ... Every Film by Hayao Miyazaki: From Studio Ghibli and More Beloved Animation Studio Ghibli Hayao Miyazaki is back! It’s been 10 years since the release of his last film, “The Wind Rises,” and now the acclaimed Studio Ghibli director returns with his supposedly final film, “The Boy and the Heron.” Released in Japan on July 14 under the title “How Do You Live?,” the latest film takes its name from a best-selling novel of the same name penned by Japanese author Genzaburo Yoshino. The film, which released with little promotional material, follows the journey of a 12-year-old boy named Mahito Maki as he stumbles upon a fantasy world with a talking grey heron. Miyazaki, who turned 82 on Jan. 5, 2023, has once again declared that “The Boy and the Heron” will be the culmination of his career – which he said seven previous times in 1986, 1992, 1997, 2001, 2004, 2008 and 2013. After each time, he withdrew from his retirement to make another film. The filmmaker began his career working in television at Toei Animation in 1963, and he made his directorial debut with the animated film “The Castle of Cagliostro” in 1979. Throughout his career, his name has become inseparable from Japanese animation. His top-grossing films include beloved classics such as “My Neighbor Totoro,” “Howl’s Moving Castle” and the Oscar winner “Spirited Away,” which have all brought joy and nostalgia to generations of viewers. “We must be idealistic realists,” said Miyazaki in the documentary “10 Years With Miyazaki.”\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2023-08-02\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d6\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2022/10/07/studio-ghibli-movies-order-of-release/8093317001/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"How many Studio Ghibli movies are there? - USA Today The latest from the animation company \\\"The Boy and the Heron\\\" hit theaters in Japan on July 14, 2023.

The film is about a young orphan girl named Earwig who moves into the home of a selfish witch; now, she must adapt to life in her new home filled with mystery, magic and potions. Despite receiving modest praise for its creative storytelling, Earwig and the Witch's animation style was one of the driving factors for Earwig and the Witch's negative reviews among critics.

What we can tell you is that The Boy and the Heron is an adaptation of a 1937 novel called How Do You Live?, about a high-school student coping with a death in his family.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

However, having solved the problems of harnessing them there is a further challenge: of integrating them into the supply system where most demand is for continuous, reliable supply. Obviously sun, wind, tides and waves cannot be controlled to provide directly either continuous dispatchable power to meet base-load demand, or peak-load power when it is needed, so how can other, dispatchable sources be operated so as to complement them? If there were some way that large amounts of electricity from intermittent variable renewable energy (VRE) producers such as solar and wind could be stored efficiently, the contribution of these technologies to supplying electricity demand would be much greater – see preceding subsection. The only renewable source with built-in storage and hence dispatchable on demand is hydro from dams. The storage can be enhanced by pumping back water when power costs are low, and such dammed hydro schemes can be complemented by off-river pumped hydro. This requires pairs of small reservoirs in hilly terrain and joined by a pipe with pump and turbine. There is some scope for reversing the whole way we look at power supply, in its 24-hour, 7-day cycle, using peak load equipment simply to meet the daily peaks. Conventional peak-load equipment can be used to some extent to provide infill capacity in a system relying heavily on VRE sources such as wind and solar. Its characteristic is rapid start-up, usually (apart from dammed hydro) with low capital and high fuel cost. Such capacity complements large-scale solar thermal and wind generation, providing power at short notice when they were unable to. This is essentially what happens with Denmark, whose wind capacity is complemented by a major link to Norwegian hydro (as well as Sweden and the north German grid). Case study: West Denmark West Denmark (the main peninsula part) is the most intensely wind-turbined part of the planet, with 1.74 per 1000 people – 4700 turbines totaling 2315 MWe, 1800 MWe of which has priority dispatch and power must be taken by the grid when it is producing.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.wri.org/insights/renewable-energy-opportunity-philippines\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Why the Time Is Right for Renewable Energy in the Philippines ... According to the World Economic Forum, citing numbers from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), every dollar invested in the clean energy transition provides 3-8 times the return. Furthermore, the widespread adoption of renewable energy creates employment opportunities up and down the supply chain. The renewable energy sector already employed 11 million people worldwide as of 2018. A May 2020 report by McKinsey showed that government spending on renewables and energy efficiency creates 3 times more jobs than spending on fossil fuels. Additionally, renewable energy can provide electricity access for all while reducing electricity costs for consumers. While millions of new consumers gained access to electricity since 2000, some 2 million people in the Philippines are still without it. Decarbonized and decentralized power generation systems that do not require pricey, massive and logistically challenging transmission networks in rugged and remote terrains would further the goal of total electrification. Providing consumer choice for low-cost clean energy sources can also result in savings and better profit margins for businesses, particularly small- and medium-sized businesses, which are more sensitive to changes in their month-to-month operational expenses than larger corporations. Finally, the low-carbon energy transition will help thwart climate change and reduce the carbon intensity of the Philippines’ power sector, as well as improve its energy system resilience. Since the Philippines is made up of more than 7,000 islands, distributed renewable energy (DRE) systems that are not dependent on the transportation of fuel are well-suited to the country's geographic profile. This reduces the need for extra-long transmission lines that can be exposed to intense storms or other natural disturbances. DREs, especially those backed by batteries, can provide fast backup power during calamities, making the energy system more resilient. A Tipping Point for Renewable Energy? While the national government has already taken some steps to transition away from fossil fuels, coal continues to dominate the Philippines’ power supply.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://norwegianscitechnews.com/2016/11/electrifying-find-can-help-stability-electric-grid/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"An electrifying find can help with stability in the electric grid An electrifying find can help with stability in the electric grid Researchers have established a technique that will help ensure a stable supply of electricity even as new renewable energy sources come on line. The trick is helping all of the subsystems to work in concert. You definitely want to have a stable supply of electricity, because without it, all your gadgets could stop working, or even worse, if the variation in voltage and frequency is too large. But delivering a stable supply of electricity is getting more and more difficult, especially as households begin to contribute with electricity from solar panels and small wind turbines. Analyzing and controlling the electric power grid requires precise measurements that are presented correctly. A new method may help ensure this. Photo: Thinkstock One of the most important aspects of ensuring the reliable operation in any electric grid is getting correct measurements and information from the system. Those measurements affect everything else. In practice, an entirely stable frequency is nearly impossible. No system is perfect, and the frequency of the electricity supply is actually constantly changing. The challenges posed by these variations have led researchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) to use a new method to analyse this phenomenon in electric power systems. More precise descriptions The NTNU researchers’ method can provide a more precise description of variations in the voltage frequency of the electric grid. These variations may oscillate around a mean value, but the lengths of their periods may differ. If these differences are not accounted for, they can, in the worst case, result in a system collapse. Small systems like wind turbines or solar cells on roofs will become more and more common over time. But the electric grid needs to be able to handle the challenges these pose. Photo: Thinkstock To analyse and manage a power grid, you have to have precise measurements and represent them correctly. Everything else is based on those measurements and their interpretation being accurate. “The new analysis method for time-varying frequency has big advantages over methods used previously and may have significant impact,” said Olav B. Fosso, a professor in the Department of Electric Power Engineering.

New solutions such as Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are emerging in the region to help build the business case for coupling this technology with renewables. By Raúl Sánchez By Joan Miquel Carrillo DATE JULY 27 2022 Just as lithium-ion batteries are powering the rise of electric vehicles, they can also play a critical role in powering the rise of electricity from renewable sources. Wind and solar produced a record 10% of global electricity in 2021. But what happens when the wind stops blowing or the sun isn’t shining? The use of batteries to store the excess energy generated from clean, intermittent sources is the obvious solution. But the development of these technologies has lagged that of renewable power generation, until now. The growth of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) can change that equation. BESS allow for smarter capture and release of energy from different sources. They can provide frequency regulation on a minute-by-minute basis to the grid, helping to keep a safe and stable power supply, among other services. They are becoming a viable solution for integrating variable renewable energy such as wind and solar into electricity systems, taking advantage of the falling cost of lithium-ion batteries over the last decade. According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), lithium-ion battery pack prices have fallen from above $1,200/kilowatt-hour (KWh) in 2010 to $132/kWh in 2021, an 89% drop in real terms. By 2024, BNEF envisions average prices will be close to $100/kWh. This evolution has mostly been driven by the surge of electric vehicles and economies of scale in industrial production of battery packs. While the use of BESS in renewable energy projects is still incipient around the world, new experiences are emerging to help build the business case for this promising storage technology. One such case is in El Salvador.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d5\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-people-who-need-arnergy-solar-arnergy?trk=pulse-article_more-articles_related-content-card\",\n    \"snippet\": \"10 People Who Need Arnergy Solar Hospitals & Clinics: Important medical facilities play very critical roles in improving the health and life value of any given community. Any moment spent without power in hospitals or clinics can create life-threatening situations for patients. A direct way for medical facilities to enjoy a constant and stable power supply is by investing in Arnergy 30000 and other high capacity Arnergy solar systems that combine sufficient power supply capacity with a flexible payment plan that eliminates initial capital outlays for hospitals and clinics. Schools & Learning Centers: Educational institutions are the bedrock of social and economical development in our society. As the home of learning, our schools and learning centers need consistent electricity to power digital learning tools as well as to maintain a conducive learning environment for the teachers and students. Arnergy solar systems are a reliable and clean source of power that eliminates the usual toxic fumes, noise pollution, and high running costs that come with diesel generators. Affordable 24/7 power supply can be assured with Arnergy solar systems so students and teachers enjoy learning moments all day with an uninterrupted power supply. Agencies: Government and private agencies need a stable power supply to deliver on sensitive national and international assignments. The effect of incessant power failure on the functions of these agencies can have negative consequences on the nation's economy and relative stability. This is why Arnergy solar often recommends high-quality solar systems with capacities ranging from 15kVA to 30kVA that can provide reliable energy for government parastatals and non-government agencies to guarantee smooth running for their day-to-day activities.

Such variations can occur over short periods (such as a quick gust of wind providing additional electricity production from turbines) and over long periods (such as the Gulf Stream moving north during winter, causing a lack of wind across the whole country). The Solution? An example of a supply surplus and a supply deficit occurring on the same day. The y-axis shows the deficit between supply and demand, with positive values indicating a lack of required electricity being supplied. There are at first two periods of supply surplus, and later a period of supply deficit. A potential solution to the deficit would be to somehow store the initial surplus for use later on. While it would theoretically be possible to build enough renewable energy sources with enough average generation capacity to meet the current demand at all times, such a plan would require a large fleet of conventional power plants in standby mode, ready to take over when the renewable energy sources cannot satisfy the demand, or build huge facilities (such as pumped storage or batteries) for long duration electricity storage. Both of these approaches require costly hardware to be built and maintained. A much more elegant solution is to find a way to store surplus energy in times of abundant supply, for use in times when supply is limited. There exist a few ideas which can help mitigate the fluctuations caused by renewable energy sources. For instance, dynamic demand control is a technique which seeks to limit an appliance's electricity consumption in times when there is limited supply, instead only using electricity when it is plentiful. Some research papers outline techniques involving devices such as fridges or electric cars. To model the effect that such techniques have, though, we need an idea of the frequency and magnitude of the fluctuations the grid based entirely on renewable energy sources would experience.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d7\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://ideas.repec.org/h/spr/prochp/978-3-030-50892-0_13.html\",\n    \"snippet\": \"A Smart Grid in Container Terminals: Cost Drivers for Using the ... Abstract The shift from conventional fuel-powered vehicles to electric vehicles is one possible step for a sustainable transformation in the logistics sector, such as at container terminals, where heavy-duty vehicles are essential for container transportation. Through the use of information systems, this field is a promising area for a smart grid application, where the batteries of idle vehicles can be used during less busy times to provide capacity for the energy grid. The need for energy reserves has increased with the integration of intermittent renewable energy sources, which cannot provide a stable power supply. The research in this chapter provides an overview of the cost drivers for a smart electrified container terminal.

Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Open since 1969, the beloved breakfast chain has served over 75 million pancakes and a whopping 210 million biscuits annually. The restaurant isn’t just popular for its food, however. The Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, which can be found inside each restaurant, sells over 70,000 rockers per year and over 3.5 million pieces of women’s apparel. Today, the chain is worth an impressive $3 billion. Originally founded in Tennessee, Cracker Barrel has a close connection with the music industry — in 2012, the restaurant released an exclusive Dolly Parton CD that went gold. Five years later, Parton again partnered with Cracker Barrel along with a cappella group Pentatonix to remake her chart-topping “Jolene,” which later went on to earn a Grammy Award for Best Country Duo/Group Performance. With a mission of “pleasing people,” Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Foundation donates millions each year to organizations like Second Harvest Food Bank of Middle Tennessee, and in 2021, the chain partnered with Feeding America to launch the Cracker Barrel Food for Families initiative. In 2005, it also launched Cracker Barrel Cares, an initiative designed to provide financial aid to employees experiencing financial hardship.

History Founding: 1969–1980 Cracker Barrel was founded in 1969 by Dan Evins, a representative for Shell Oil, who developed the restaurant and gift store concept initially as a plan to improve gasoline sales.[5] Designed to resemble the traditional country store that he remembered from his childhood, with a name chosen to give it a Southern country theme,[6] Cracker Barrel was intended to attract the interest of highway travelers.[5] The name comes from the barrels of soda crackers that could be found for sale in small-town stores across the American South in the early 1900s; people would stand around the barrels chatting and catching up, similar in purpose to contemporary office water coolers.[7] Evins incorporated Cracker Barrel in February 1970,[5] and soon opened more locations.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2025-03-02\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.statista.com/statistics/868969/cracker-barrel-number-of-stores-us/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Cracker Barrel's store count in the United States 2011-2024 - Statista In 2024, there were 658 Cracker Barrel stores in the US, down from 661 the previous year.

Location-Specific Décor As you look for Cracker Barrels along your travel route, it is interesting to note that each of the chain’s 665 locations is decorated with authentic American artifacts. Reproductions are strictly forbidden. Not only that, but each location’s décor is unique. The company’s décor team chooses items that reflect the history and culture of the area where the restaurant is located, meaning the décor in the Bakersfield, California Cracker Barrel will be quite different from that of the store in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania. In this way, each restaurant also becomes a local museum of sorts. It’s one more pretty neat reason to seek out a Cracker Barrel while traveling. While many of these antiques are unique to a store’s specific area, there are a few items that are universal. Every Cracker Barrel location features a traffic light over the restrooms, an ox yoke and a horseshoe hanging over the front door, an antique cookstove (usually found in the retail area), a taxidermy deer head hanging above a wood-burning fireplace, and a barrel with a checkerboard in front of that fireplace.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only.

And a growing number of vegans carve out a head-scratching exception to another type of food entirely: oysters. How can a person committed to not eating animal products justify the consumption of oysters? Well, it all boils down to some long forgotten sixth grade science class lessons. Though oysters definitely fall somewhere within the animal kingdom (in the superfamily Ostreoidea, to be exact), some argue that they are more akin to plants. Advertisement Advertisement Oysters on the half shell — Photo courtesy of iStock / Larry Zhou Consider the sessile (immobile) nature of the oyster, for starters. And then there’s the fact that oysters lack a central nervous system, casting their ability to think and feel – at least in a manner that humans can make sense of – into doubt. Even the famed ethicist Peter Singer has written in \\\"Animal Liberation\\\" that \\\"One cannot with any confidence say that these creatures do feel pain, so one can equally have little confidence in saying that they do not feel pain.\\\" Oyster-eating vegans once again suggest that this makes the animals more plant-like than we otherwise assume. While oysters might not have brains in the vertebrate sense, they do possess some comparable organs to humans. Chief among these are an oyster’s heart and its kidneys.

They are a hugely popular “seafood,” and can be eaten both raw and cooked. In 2022, the oyster market reached 7.11 million tons worldwide. They are often considered an aphrodisiac, and are commonly served still in their shell. China is the world’s largest producer of oysters, and they are also popular in the US, France, Canada, Japan, Aotearoa (New Zealand), and the UK. Are oysters vegan? In short, the answer is no. Oysters are animals, and eating them is therefore not considered compatible with a vegan lifestyle. Yet many vegans are asked whether they consume them. At first glance this question can seem strange; oysters have long been part of the animal kingdom, why would anyone think they’re a reasonable part of a plant-based diet? Part of this comes down to their experiences with pain and sentience. Do oysters feel pain? Adobe Stock Many people believe that oysters are incapable of feeling pain Some people claim that oysters are vegan-friendly due to a belief that they are not sentient creatures capable of feeling pain. Pain is a subjective experience and impossible to measure in any animal. However, most people will class an animal as capable of pain if they have a central nervous system and brain. Oysters have neither of these, which has led many to assume that they are not capable of such emotions. While it may be less likely they feel pain compared to animals like dogs, cats, fish, and insects, there is no scientific evidence that proves it. Oysters do have a basic nervous system and a small heart and internal organs. Some scientists believe that, while they may not experience pain in the same way as us, they could still respond to negative stimuli. This may indicate that they are capable of something at least resembling pain. Other scientists state, however, that such responses are reflex, rather than pain-driven. Should vegans eat oysters?

Commentary The Case For Eating Oysters — Even If You're A Vegan As a vegetarian, I pass on summer delicacies I enjoyed as a child. Burgers and hot dogs off the grill? Not on my Fourth of July menu. Chicken? Only if it’s made of soy. Freshly caught bluefish or salmon? Mouth-watering but verboten. Of course, from juicy tomatoes to corn on the cob, I savor summer’s vegetable bounty with everyone else. And there’s another summer staple I eat without guilt: oysters. What’s more, even vegans, whose diets forbid animals and animal products like cheese and honey (both of which I permit myself), should feel free to savor oysters “by the boatload.” That goes for mussels, too. Technically, vegans who eat these simple shellfish are “ostrovegans.” Guzzling them isn’t culinary sacrilege, if your goal is to avoid inflicting suffering on animals — not just slaughter but also the fear and discomfort of industrial husbandry’s inhumane confinement. The belief that oysters and mussels can feel pain and discomfort is as rooted in science as the nostrum that you shouldn’t eat the former in months with an “r” in their names. Biology suggests that both bivalves are the functional equivalent of plants, without the capacity for pain. They lack what would be considered a central nervous system and brain. Nor can they move on their own. Evolutionists point out that motion and a nervous system are nature’s tools for sensing and moving away from painful stimuli. Of course, we can’t be 100 percent sure they don’t feel pain in some way we don’t understand. But as a Slate writer noted, the same is true of plants.

If you’ve reached this article, then you are well acquainted with the definition of veganism, which is a stance against the purposeful exploitation of animal species as is practical. It’s troubling to find numerous members in the vegan community supporting the exploitation of animal species based on articles unsupported by a single shred of evidence. More alarming is how these articles try to establish oysters, mussels, and even other animals in the vegan community as being akin to plants, rocks, and as one stated, “a disembodied finger.” Modern molecular and taxonomic advances have led scientists to base classification of living beings in very specific ways. I won’t further delve into the subject, but I will say that oysters and other animal species are not comparable to plants. The plant and animal kingdom are separate for good reason regardless of what supporters of bivalve eating in the vegan community will have you believe. One of the most important differences is that plants do not have a nervous system while bivalves do. The same bivalve eating individuals claim that mussels and oysters are not sentient because they do not have “brains,” and while it is true that mussels and oyster do not have a brain in the sense that you or I do, they do have ganglia. Ganglia, in simple terms, is basically their form of a brain — how they get their systems to function and respond when they need to. Yes, invertebrates have much simpler nervous systems than vertebrates, but they still have nervous systems. How developed their nervous system depends on the species. More importantly, their form of a nervous system allows them to respond to their living conditions and survive in them. “Most, if not all, invertebrates have the capacity to detect and respond to noxious or aversive stimuli. That is, like vertebrates, they are capable of ‘nociception” (Smith 1991).\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d7\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://simplyhealthyvegan.com/is-shellfish-off-limits-for-vegans-the-answer-might-surprise-you/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Is Shellfish Off-Limits For Vegans?

Despite their lack of pain, they are members of the animal kingdom. Oysters do have Omega-3 fatty acids, which are beneficial for blood pressure control. In the world of vegans, there are numerous low-cost alternatives available. The health of the sea ecosystem is greatly affected by oysters. A filter feeder consumes up to 50 gallons of water per day for oysters. This means that there are no toxic chemicals in the environment, which is ideal for seabed grasses and aquatic life. A PETA investigation concluded that oyster consumption is not permitted. A person does not experience pain as a result of their lack of a central nervous system. The mollusk is already being slaughtered by pearl farmers when you see an open oyster. Are Oysters Vegan Peta? Some vegans feel compelled to consume oysters due to the pain they experience when they do so. As a result, PETA has confirmed that oysters are not suitable for vegan consumption due to their status as an animal product. Vegan-friendly Ways To Enjoy Pearls Pearls, on the other hand, can be used in a variety of ways, such as jewelry, smoothies, or made into a vegan dessert. Is An Oyster A Sentient Being? A vegan diet, according to him, is all about compassion, and oysters, according to current research, are sensory animals without a brain or advanced central nervous system, which means they cannot feel pain.

Oyster Farming Is Sustainable Each year, billions of invertebrates that live in water are consumed. This is not just harmful to fish. Diverse methods of fishing may result in tenfold more deaths and a complete upheaval of marine biological diversity. That is another reason for vegans not to consume seafood but oysters are not harvested from the wilderness, along with their native population is not harmed. Some may even argue for oyster farms contribute to the improvement of water quality. They perform a crucial function in water filtration and clarity improvement. Consequently of their filtration, oysters also contribute to the improvement of marine animal habitats. 3. Nutritional Benefits Oysters are rich in vitamins and minerals such as vitamin B12, iron, omega-3 fatty acids, Vitamin D, zinc, and selenium, which vegans do not get enough of regularly. The protein content of one little oyster is 5 grams, whereas a large oyster contains 10 grams of protein. Also, oysters are renowned for their aphrodisiac qualities. What Are the Reasons Vegans Don’t Support Eating Oysters? 1. Oysters May Sense Pain Some researchers suggest that mollusks are more likely than previously believed to possess some degree of consciousness. Oysters do have intestines and cardiovascular organs, but no brain which is the counterargument to the central nervous system theory. Ganglia is found in oysters, which process information without a brain, allowing them to sense their surroundings to some degree.

However, there are some vegans who purely go vegan for the health benefits. And that’s completely okay! There are a lot of health benefits when going vegan, and that’s something anyone can enjoy. Ostrovegan: Will Eat Bivalves (like Oysters). So what’s the deal with ostrovegans? You may have never heard this term. An ostrovegan is a vegan who eats oysters and other bivalves (like mussels, clams, and scallops). Since bivalves, such as oysters, do not have pain receptors, ostrovegans argue that eating them is not cruel. This is a controversial topic among the vegan community and is not a viewpoint shared by most vegans. Keep in mind, also, there are two types of ostrovegans: those who only eat oysters and mussels, versus those who include clams and scallops, as well. Why the difference? Oysters and mussels are “sessile,” meaning they do not move. Therefore, there is more of a logical reason to believe they do not feel pain. (What would be the evolutionary function of pain in an organism that can’t move away?) Clams and scallops are motile, meaning they move around. This means there would be more evolutionary function of them feeling pain. It’s still unclear to what degree they do feel pain, though. Seagan: Will Eat Any Seafood. “Seagan” might be a newer addition to the vegan community, but it is another term that should be acknowledged on this topic. A seagan is maybe most related to a pescetarian. Basically, pescetarians are vegetarians who eat fish and seafood, while seagans are vegans who eat fish and seafood.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d10\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://allplants.com/blog/lifestyle/are-oysters-vegan\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Are Oysters Vegan? - allplants Lifestyle 2min read Share Are Oysters Vegan? 2min read It may seem like an open-and-shut case, but the amount of people who consider themselves vegan but eat oysters might surprise you. So, are oysters vegan? What are oysters, anyway? Oysters are the common given name for bivalve molluscs, which are the same family as clams, cockles, and mussels. As you already know, they live in the ocean and are effectively headless, invertebrate creatures (they don’t have spinal columns). But why do some people consider oysters to be vegan? Oysters are living creatures, so the assumption would be that they’re not vegan. However, as oysters do not have a central nervous system, they are not believed to be sentient and so don’t feel pain. As a result, some vegans who turn to the diet for reasons of animal cruelty may make an exception knowing that ultimately oysters don’t feel anything. As well as this, 95% of oysters in the world are farmed, however, the farming is sustainable and actually doesn’t negatively affect the environment. Oysters purify the water they’re in, taking in CO2 and nitrogen from the atmosphere, meaning they can actually impact the environment positively. As lots of people go vegan for environmental reasons above all, some make an exception for oysters due to its sustainable and environmentally-friendly farming practices. But are they really vegan? By definition, no, oysters are not vegan; they are still living organisms which means they can’t be considered a vegan food.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

How to Boost Recovery Can TBI Patients Fully Recover? Tips to Boost Chances of a Higher Recovery Can TBI patients fully recover from their injury? There are many misconceptions that surround TBI recovery. Unfortunately, these can make people believe they will live with the effects of traumatic brain injury forever. While this is sometimes true, the reality is many TBI patients can continue to make great strides in their recovery, even years after their injury. While it is not possible to predict any particular patient’s outcome, the chances of making a full recovery from TBI are much higher than most may think. In this article, we will share some important facts about TBI rehabilitation plus tips on how to promote a more full recovery. Is There a Time Limit for Making a Full TBI Recovery? Before explaining how patients can maximize chances of fully recovering from TBI, we need to address a harmful myth about recovery: “the two-year myth.” In the past, most rehab specialists believed that TBI recovery peaked around two years post-injury. Today, however, research demonstrates that this idea is false. In fact, TBI patients can recover their abilities long after the two-year mark. For example, a study that followed TBI patients for a decade found that even at the 10-year mark some patients were still improving their function. “At 24 months after recovery, I was not yet reading or writing as I am today. I also still needed attendant care around the clock. Because of long-term follow-up, I can now drive and live on my own…I would never have been able to make progress if my rehabilitation had stopped at 24 months.” Therefore, a full and functional TBI recovery is almost always possible, even though it might take several years of dedication. But in order to make this type of progress, you must take initiative. In fact, without consistent work, brain injury recovery can stall and even regress. Therefore, it is critical for TBI patients to be pro-active in their rehab. The more you work to promote a full recovery from TBI the more success you will enjoy. In the sections below, we will cover a few concrete actions you can take to accomplish this.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://msktc.org/tbi/factsheets/understanding-tbi-part-3-recovery-process\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Understanding TBI: Part 3 - The Recovery Process | MSKTC ’s real and what isn’t. They may see things that aren’t there. This stage can be disturbing for family because the person behaves so uncharacteristically. Inconsistent behavior is also common. Some days are better than others. This stage of recovery may last days or even weeks for some people. In this stage of recovery, ups and downs are normal and are not cause for concern. Ups and downs are normal. Later stages of recovery can bring increased mental and physical function. In most cases, the person’s ability to respond gets better over time. Length of recovery Often, the fastest improvement happens in the first six months after injury. During this time, the person with the injury will likely move and think better. As time goes by, the speed of improvement will slow down, but the person may continue to gain more function for years after the injury. Rate of improvement varies from person to person. We do not know the reasons that the rate is different between people. For this reason, it is recommended that people with injury do what they can to support the health of their brain for the rest of their lives. Brain health is supported through healthy behaviors, such as exercise and avoiding alcohol and other drugs Long-term impacts It is common and understandable for family members and other caregivers to have many questions about the long-term effects of the brain injury on the injured person’s ability to function in the future. Unfortunately, when a person first starts to get better, it’s hard to know the long-term effects for many reasons. We have just begun to understand the possible effects of TBI many years after injury. The TBI Model System program will continue to do studies focusing on outcome after TBI. Brain scans and other tests are not always able to show the full extent of the injury, so early in recovery it is sometimes difficult to understand how serious the injury is. The type of brain injury and extent of related problems, such as brain swelling, varies a great deal from person to person.

Traumatic Brain Injury Recovery: Can You Recover from a TBI? If you’ve experienced a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it’s natural to want to know how long and how difficult your recovery is going to be. There are so many factors affecting recovery time — such as the specifics of the injury, gender, treatment options, and more. Remember, the length and extent of your recovery is unique toyou. Recovery stories vary even between patients with similar injuries. But the good news is that — with the right support — TBI patients with long-term symptoms can continue to show improvement even many years after the injury. To some extent, the success you see during recovery is linked to your willingness to engage in therapy and persist with treatment recommendations. But it’s also possible to try so hard that you wear out your brain and slow down recovery progress. Or, your brain might only respond to a type of therapy to a point, and then need something else to move forward. Recovering from a TBI is a “work smarter, not harder” situation. You need the right professional guidance at each stage of your recovery. At our clinic, Cognitive FX, we’ve treated numerous TBI patients who stalled in their long-term recovery before reaching out to us. They were working hard, trying their best, but not seeing the improvements they wanted to see. That’s because they had reached the limit of what their current providers could help them through. But with our advanced imaging techniques (functional Neurocognitive Imaging, or fNCI for short), we can “see” which parts of the brain are underperforming compared to a database of healthy brain images. Armed with this insight, we can tailor the many therapies at our disposal to target your unique brain injury(more on this in a bit). Although we cannot guarantee a full recovery for every patient, we’ve seen many of our patients with severe traumatic brain injuries improve beyond their initial prognosis. While you might never return to the level of functioning you enjoyed before the injury, you can still make great progress and find significant symptom relief.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.bergerandgreen.com/faqs/can-you-recover-from-a-traumatic-brain-injury/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Can You Recover From a Traumatic Brain Injury? | Berger and Green Can You Recover from a Traumatic Brain Injury? Some people can recover from a traumatic brain injury (TBI) fully if the injury is mild to moderate. Some people with severe TBIs can also make a full recovery, based on their prognosis and medical treatment. According to the Mayo Clinic, TBIs are caused by hitting your head or an object piercing your skull and reaching your brain. TBI symptoms and complications include: Unconsciousness Headaches Seizures Coma Infections Brain death Seeking Medical Treatment The most important way to work towards recovering from a TBI is to seek medical treatment immediately after an accident where you injure your head. TBI symptoms tend to show up after the accident, which prompts many victims to think they are fine following an accident. However, if you go too long without getting treated and your symptoms progress, it might be more difficult to fully recover. According to the Mayo Clinic, treatment for TBIs can include the following: Medication If the TBI is mild or moderate, some symptoms might include fluid build-up in the brain and seizures. Doctors often prescribe medication to mitigate these symptoms. Diuretics help to reduce the fluid build-up and pressure in the brain following a TBI. They might also prescribe drugs to prevent seizures. If a TBI causes damage to a patient’s blood vessels, inhibiting oxygen from getting to their brain, doctors might induce a coma, which will lower the amount of oxygen the brain needs. Surgery A TBI might also require emergency surgery in order to mitigate the risks of fluid build-up, a fractured skull, blood clotting, and brain bleeds. Following Up on Medical Care Even if you suffered a TBI and sought the appropriate medical attention initially, you might still need ongoing care in order to recover as much as possible. Some people with severe TBIs might need rehabilitation to relearn how to speak, walk, write, and perform other basic tasks.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d5\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stroke/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Stroke - NHS Treating a stroke Treatment depends on the type of stroke you have, including which part of the brain was affected and what caused it. Strokes are usually treated with medicine. This includes medicines to prevent and dissolve blood clots, reduce blood pressure and reduce cholesterol levels. In some cases, procedures may be required to remove blood clots. Surgery may also be needed to treat brain swelling and reduce the risk of further bleeding if this was the cause of your stroke. Recovering from a stroke People who survive a stroke are often left with long-term problems caused by injury to their brain. Some people need a long period of rehabilitation before they can recover their former independence, while many never fully recover and need ongoing support after their stroke. Local authorities should provide free reablement services for anyone assessed as needing them. These services help the person recovering from a stroke learn or relearn the skills they need to live at home independently. Some people will continue to need some form of care or help with their daily activities. For example, a care worker may come to the person's home to help with washing and dressing, or to provide companionship. Preventing a stroke If you have a condition that increases your risk of a stroke, it's important to manage it effectively. For example, taking medicine you've been prescribed to lower high blood pressure or cholesterol levels. If you've had a stroke or TIA in the past, these measures are particularly important because your risk of having another stroke is greatly increased.

What effects can a stroke have? The effects of stroke depend on the size and location of the damaged area in your brain. For some people the effects of a stroke may be relatively minor and may not last long, while others may be left with long-term effects or a disability. Stroke can have a powerful emotional effect on you and the people around you. Many people have emotional changes after a stroke, including anxiety and depression. A stroke can change how people see themselves. Stroke usually comes as a big shock, and many people say they have lost some of their confidence. Help is available with emotional problems, so if you feel low or anxious, or think you may be depressed, visit your GP. Will I be able to make a full recovery? Everyone recovers differently. Some people recover fully. Other people will have health problems or a disability. The fastest recovery takes place in the first few months. After that progress can be slower, but people can continue to improve for months or years after a stroke. Rehabilitation You should receive rehabilitation soon after your stroke. It may begin in hospital and should carry on at home if you need it. Rehabilitation is part of your recovery. It means trying to restore function to as near normal as possible, and helping you adapt to disability. During rehabilitation, the therapist assesses you and designs treatment tailored to your needs. Depending on the type of therapy, you may have exercises to practise. You may work towards building up stamina, or learn new ways of doing things. Neuroplasticity Although brain cells that have been severely damaged or have died can’t grow back, the brain can re-wire itself, allowing you to relearn things like walking, speech and swallowing. This is called neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity is the process that happens in the brain when you do rehabilitation therapy.

The first mode of concussion recovery involves the memory, thinking, and behavioral symptoms The second mode involves the physiological condition of the brain The study could lead to important changes to the recovery timeline following any brain injury, even those considered \\\"mild.\\\" The research used specialized MRI brain scans using a different technique from typical brain scans to identify ongoing brain abnormalities. A traditional CT or MRI often does not show the small changes in brain physiology and function described in the study. The study author said that lack of evidence may drive an inaccurate perception that \\\"any persistent symptoms are psychological.\\\" A patient suffering real brain damage may be pushed back into action or have his or her symptoms ignored based on inadequate testing. The study provides some evidence that the elevated risk of a second brain injury may persist for months after the symptoms of a first injury disappear.

Individualized Brain Injury Representation Brain injuries are some of the most damaging and complex injuries an accident can cause. Traumatic brain injuries and acquired brain injuries greatly affect the victim and may not ever allow him or her to fully recover from the accident. Serious brain damage may also occur as a result of a severe head injury.

This can occur from a blow, impact, or severe back-and-forth motion, such as whiplash. The brain is a very complex and delicate organ. Scientists have yet to discover all of the functions of the brain and its capabilities. However, they do know the brain can be injured very easily, and the damage can last a lifetime. If that occurs, learning how to treat a brain injury is important. The brain may also be injured from being shaken. This can occur in an auto accident when a severe jolt is felt by the body, like when a vehicle is impacted by another. Whiplash to the neck is only one of the injuries that can occur when this happens. Brain injuries can lead to loss of motor skills, memory, or bodily functions. It can also cause changes to the personality, with quick-to-anger responses being the most common change. These changes to body functions and personality traits can become permanent if the damage is severe. When a person suffers from traumatic brain injury (TBI), it may take years of therapy and other treatments to recover. In some severe cases, recovery may not be possible.

The patient may also have mental health symptoms such as depression or anxiety. Or be more fatigued. These can also be symptoms of a head injury though you may not relate the symptoms to a head injury. Is a Head Injury the Same as a Brain Injury? Both head injury and brain injury are usually terms used when an injury to the head and the brain is involved. Sometimes when the words are used, “brain injury” is used when a more severe injury. Also, we often hear “brain injury” when rehab for brain injury is necessary. It is important to know that a brain injury is a more serious problem, and damage to the brain generally requires help at a neuro-rehabilitation center to make a full recovery. A traumatic brain injury may have a permanent effect on the patient’s quality of life, which is not always the case with a head injury. That said, there is hope for recovery and improved quality of life with help from a well-trained, compassionate treatment team. Can Someone Fully Recover From Traumatic Brain Injury? Moderate or severe Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBIs) can result in some amount of permanent disability. However, post-acute rehabilitation can help reduce the degree of disability the individual experiences. Patients can also learn to live with the long-term effects and coping mechanisms for success. This is where rehabilitation is so important. Not only are the physical challenges overwhelming, but the emotional challenges are tough. Facing the implication and factoring that they may have difficulty “returning to normal” can be devastating for TBI patients and loved ones. Neuro Rehab staff helps both patients and family members heal and find hope within this new normal. With the treatment team’s assistance, both patients and staff understand they are not alone in the process and have hope for healing. This is how you can have the best outcome for the patient in the long term.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Rheumatoid factors are immune system proteins that sometimes attack the healthy tissue in your body. A rheumatoid factor test measures the level of rheumatoid factor proteins in your bloodstream. High levels of rheumatoid factors often point to rheumatoid arthritis, as well as Sjogren’s syndrome, and other autoimmune conditions. Results that show a high level can be helpful in confirming a rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis. However, people without autoimmune conditions sometimes have a high level of rheumatoid factor proteins, and not everyone with rheumatoid arthritis has a high level of rheumatoid factor proteins. Cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies are a type of immune system protein called an autoantibody. Autoantibodies are abnormal proteins that attack healthy blood cells and tissues. Between 60 and 80 percent of people with rheumatoid arthritis have CCP antibodies in their blood. An anti-CCP antibody test — also called an ACCP test or CCP-test — looks for the presence of these antibodies to help confirm rheumatoid arthritis. An anti-CCP test can also help doctors determine the severity of a rheumatoid arthritis case. High levels of CCP at diagnosis indicate an increased risk for the fast progression of joint damage. Doctors typically perform both a rheumatoid factor (RF) test and an anti-CCP test when evaluating a person they suspect may have rheumatoid arthritis.

Lab tests and imaging tests can help your doctor make the diagnosis. Diagnostic Lab Tests Evidence of RA may be seen in the blood, so blood tests play an important role in making a diagnosis. Following are some of the tests your doctor may order. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR or sed rate). The ESR can gauge how much inflammation is in your body by measuring how quickly red blood cells (erythrocytes) separate from other cells in the blood and collect as sediment in the bottom of a test tube. Because inflammation can be caused by conditions other than RA, the results must be considered along with those of other tests when making an RA diagnosis. C-Reactive Protein (CRP). This measures levels of CRP, a protein produced by the liver that signals inflammation. High CRP levels are common in RA and other inflammatory forms of arthritis. Because a high CRP may be present with many diseases and conditions, a high CRP in itself does not mean you have arthritis or identify which form you may have. The results must be interpreted in the context of your symptoms as well as the results of other tests. Rheumatoid factor (RF). Rheumatoid factor is a protein made by the immune system which may attack healthy tissues. High levels of rheumatoid factor could help your doctor make a diagnosis of RA. However, RF levels may also be high in other autoimmune diseases, so an RF test alone cannot be used to diagnose RA. Anti-CCP antibody test (ACCP or CCP). This test is for a type of autoantibody called cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies, which can be found in the blood of 60% to 80% of people with rheumatoid arthritis.

Blood tests are usually fast. The doctor sends you to a lab where a worker puts a needle into one of your veins. They take, or \\\"draw,\\\" blood into several test tubes. The tests take a few days, and the doctor will call you to go over the results. Common blood tests for rheumatoid arthritis include: What it measures: Rheumatoid factor is a group of proteins your body makes when your immune system attacks healthy tissue. Whatâs normal: 0-20 u/mL (units per milliliter of blood) Whatâs high: 20 u/mL or higher What it means: About 70% to 90% of people with a high reading have RA. But people without RA can still have rheumatoid factor. In general, if you have RA but donât have high RF, your disease will be less severe. RF levels may stay high even if you go into remission. What it measures: Proteins your body makes when there is inflammation. Youâll probably have it done along with the RF test. Whatâs normal: 20 u/mL or less What it means: This test offers a way to catch RA in its early stages. Levels are high in people who have RA or those who are about to get it. A positive test means thereâs a 97% chance you have RA. If you have anti-CCP antibodies, your rheumatoid arthritis might be more severe. Other conditions you might have: None.

However RA is eventually defined, there are two main subtypes in adults: seropositive and seronegative. In seropositive RA, blood tests show unusually high levels of antibodies called anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides (anti-CCPs). These are specific markers for RA and may show up as much as a decade before symptoms do. Around 60% to 80% of people diagnosed with RA have anti-CCPs. By definition, people with seronegative RA don’t have these antibodies in their blood, though that’s in some dispute. Doctors once used an antibody called rheumatoid factor (RF) to test for seropositivity. Most people with anti-CCPs also have RF, but so do people with lots of other conditions, including infections. That’s why anti-CCP is now the preferred test, though an RF test is often used in conjunction with it for greater accuracy. The Role of Blood Tests in RA Diagnosis No single blood test can reliably diagnose RA. Some healthy people test positive for anti-CCPs, while others who have RA have negative test results. Blood tests are just one of several factors, including a medical history, physical exam and X-rays, that help doctors diagnose the disease. Still, antibodies are a pretty good indicator of RA if you have also have joint pain and swelling and damage to bones and cartilage on imaging tests. Seronegative RA is more challenging and takes longer to diagnose because doctors try to rule out other types of arthritis that aren’t associated with high levels of anti-CCP, such as psoriatic arthritis, gout and spondyloarthritis. Still, seronegative RA remains an imprecise diagnosis, according to some experts. It’s rare for someone who is seronegative to become seropositive, but it’s not uncommon for a diagnosis of seronegative RA to be changed to something else later on.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d5\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4924-rheumatoid-arthritis\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA): Causes, Symptoms & Treatment FAQs ’re more likely to develop RA if you have a close relative who also has it.

Diagnosis and Tests How is rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed? Your healthcare provider may refer you to a physician who specializes in arthritis (rheumatologist). Rheumatologists diagnose people with rheumatoid arthritis based on a combination of several factors. They’ll do a physical exam and ask you about your medical history and symptoms. Your rheumatologist will order blood tests and imaging tests. The blood tests look for inflammation and blood proteins (antibodies) that are signs of rheumatoid arthritis. These may include: About 60% to 70% of people living with rheumatoid arthritis have antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptides (CCP) (proteins). Your rheumatologist may order imaging tests to look for signs that your joints are wearing away. Rheumatoid arthritis can cause the ends of the bones within your joints to wear down. The imaging tests may include: In some cases, your provider may watch how you do over time before making a definitive diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. What are the diagnostic criteria for rheumatoid arthritis? Diagnostic criteria are a set of signs, symptoms and test results your provider looks for before telling you that you’ve got rheumatoid arthritis.

As with many blood tests, labs each have their own, slightly different reading of what ESR numbers mean, which they interpret based on past results, explains Cadet. Age is also a factor. “ESR can be elevated slightly in elderly patients and still be normal for that person,” she says.

Psoriatic Arthritis Blood Test: C-Reactive Protein C-reactive protein (CRP) is a protein in the blood that indicates inflammation. If a blood test shows high CRP levels, you might have psoriatic arthritis, explains Dr. Husni. “Your doctor may use the test if your ESR is normal, since CRP is more accurate at detecting inflammation in some people,” adds Cadet. Again, different labs may have slightly different interpretations of readings. Frequency of TestingCRP analysis may be done for diagnosis and then several times a year to assess whether inflammation has responded to treatment, notes Cadet. 5. Psoriatic Arthritis Blood Test: Rheumatoid Factor Rheumatoid factor (RF), a protein produced by the immune system that can be a marker for autoimmune dysfunction, is sometimes an indication of systemic inflammation.

In most people diagnosed with RA, blood tests reveal abnormally high levels of antibodies called rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP), which signal that the immune system is in overdrive and may be attacking healthy tissues instead of just foreign invaders like germs. The majority of rheumatoid arthritis patients are seropositive: 50 percent to 70 percent of RA patients have anti-CCP antibodies and 65 percent to 80 percent have rheumatoid factor antibodies, research shows. However, this means that a sizeable number of people with RA are considered to be seronegative, which means they don’t have either of these antibodies in their blood. Keep in mind that blood tests are just one part of the process that doctors use to diagnose RA. Learn more about different tests that diagnose RA here. How Are Blood Tests Used to Help Diagnose RA? RF and anti-CCP tests don’t definitively point to RA because some healthy people without RA test positive for these antibodies, while other people who do have autoimmune problems test negative, says Umbreen Hasan, MD, consultant rheumatologist for Allina Health in Minnesota. That’s why doctors will also consider RA symptoms, inflammation levels, and the amount of joint swelling with the help of X-rays and ultrasounds.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d8\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.versusarthritis.org/about-arthritis/conditions/rheumatoid-arthritis/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Rheumatoid arthritis | Causes, symptoms, treatments If they think you have rheumatoid arthritis, they will refer you to a rheumatologist and may arrange blood tests to help confirm a diagnosis. Blood tests There's no single blood test that can confirm you have rheumatoid arthritis. However, there are a few tests that can show possible signs of the condition. Some of the main tests are outlined below. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) A sample of your red blood cells are put into a test tube of liquid. The cells are timed to see how long they take to get to the bottom of the tube. If the cells sink faster than usual, you may have levels of inflammation that are higher than normal. Rheumatoid arthritis is just one possible cause. C-reactive protein (CRP) This test can show if there is inflammation in your body. It does this by checking how much CRP there is in your blood. If there is more CRP than usual, you may have inflammation in your body. Full blood count A full blood count measures the number of red blood cells you have. These carry iron around your body, and a low number of red blood cells means you have a low iron content. This may mean you have anaemia (an-ee-me-er) and is common in people with RA, although having anaemia doesn't prove you have RA. Rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibodies About half of all people with rheumatoid arthritis have rheumatoid factor in their blood when the condition starts. However, around 1 in every 20 people without rheumatoid arthritis also test positive for rheumatoid factor. There is another antibody test called anti-CCP that you can take. People who test positive for anti-CCP are very likely to get rheumatoid arthritis. However, not everyone that has the condition has this antibody.

Frequently Asked Questions 1. Can rheumatoid arthritis be diagnosed with a blood test alone? No, rheumatoid arthritis cannot be diagnosed with a blood test alone. While certain blood markers can indicate the presence of the disease, a comprehensive evaluation that includes clinical examination, medical history, and imaging tests is necessary for an accurate diagnosis. 2. What other tests may be done to diagnose rheumatoid arthritis? In addition to blood tests, imaging tests such as X-rays, ultrasounds, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be done to assess joint damage and inflammation. These tests can provide valuable information to support the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. 3. Can rheumatoid arthritis be cured? Currently, there is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis. However, with early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, the symptoms can be managed effectively, and joint damage can be minimized. 4. What are the treatment options for rheumatoid arthritis? The treatment of rheumatoid arthritis typically involves a combination of medication, physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are commonly prescribed to slow down the progression of the disease and reduce inflammation. 5. How can I manage the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis? In addition to medical treatment, there are several self-care strategies that can help manage the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. These include regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, applying heat or cold to affected joints, and using assistive devices to reduce joint stress. 6. Can rheumatoid arthritis affect other parts of the body? Yes, rheumatoid arthritis can affect other parts of the body besides the joints. It can cause inflammation in the eyes, lungs, heart, and blood vessels, leading to complications in these organs. 7. Is rheumatoid arthritis hereditary?\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d10\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.ccjm.org/content/86/3/198\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Laboratory tests in rheumatology: A rational approach | Cleveland ... Hence, a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis cannot be confirmed with a positive result alone, nor can it be excluded with a negative result. Anticitrullinated peptide antibody, on the other hand, is much more specific for rheumatoid arthritis (95%), as it is seldom seen in other conditions, but its sensitivity is similar to that of rheumatoid factor (68%).4–6 A positive result would thus lend strength to the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, but a negative result would not exclude it. Approach to early arthritis When faced with a patient with early arthritis, some key questions to ask include7,8: Is this an inflammatory or a mechanical problem? Inflammatory arthritis is suggested by joint swelling that is not due to trauma or bony hypertrophy, early morning stiffness lasting longer than 30 minutes, and elevated inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein). Involvement of the small joints of the hands and feet may be suggested by pain on compression of the metacarpophalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints, respectively. Is there a definite identifiable underlying cause for the inflammatory arthritis? The pattern of development of joint symptoms or the presence of extraarticular symptoms may suggest an underlying problem such as gout, psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or sarcoidosis. If the arthritis is undifferentiated (ie, there is no definite identifiable cause), is it likely to remit or persist? This is perhaps the most important question to ask in order to prognosticate.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  }\n]\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"Blood tests such as rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibody tests can help confirm a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.\",\n    \"quote\": \"Results that show a high level can be helpful in confirming a rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis. ...

Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written.

Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

We’ve confirmed more than 5,800 exoplanets out of the billions that we believe exist. Overview Most of the exoplanets discovered so far are in a relatively small region of our galaxy, the Milky Way.

Even the closest known exoplanet to Earth, Proxima Centauri b, is still about 4 light-years away. We know there are more planets than stars in the galaxy. By measuring exoplanets’ sizes (diameters) and masses (weights), we can see compositions ranging from rocky (like Earth and Venus) to gas-rich (like Jupiter and Saturn). Some planets may be dominated by water or ice, while others are dominated by iron or carbon. We’ve identified lava worlds covered in molten seas, puffy planets the density of Styrofoam and dense cores of planets still orbiting their stars.

A. H. Walker, and Stephenson Yang of the University of Victoria and the University of British Columbia.[59] Although they were cautious about claiming a planetary detection, their radial-velocity observations suggested that a planet orbits the star Gamma Cephei. Partly because the observations were at the very limits of instrumental capabilities at the time, astronomers remained skeptical for several years about this and other similar observations. It was thought some of the apparent planets might instead have been brown dwarfs, objects intermediate in mass between planets and stars. In 1990, additional observations were published that supported the existence of the planet orbiting Gamma Cephei,[60] but subsequent work in 1992 again raised serious doubts.[61] Finally, in 2003, improved techniques allowed the planet's existence to be confirmed.[62] On 9 January 1992, radio astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail announced the discovery of two planets orbiting the pulsarPSR 1257+12.[45] This discovery was confirmed, and is generally considered to be the first definitive detection of exoplanets. Follow-up observations solidified these results, and confirmation of a third planet in 1994 revived the topic in the popular press.[63] These pulsar planets are thought to have formed from the unusual remnants of the supernova that produced the pulsar, in a second round of planet formation, or else to be the remaining rocky cores of gas giants that somehow survived the supernova and then decayed into their current orbits. As pulsars are aggressive stars, it was considered unlikely at the time that a planet may be able to be formed in their orbit.[64]\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-12-27\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://spaceexplored.com/how-many-exoplanets-are-there-discovered/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"How many exoplanets have been discovered? - Space Explored NASA estimates that there are over 100 billion exoplanets in our galaxy. Here's how many have been found and which are Earth-like. How many exoplanets have been discovered? NASA estimates that the Milky Way Galaxy is home to at least 100 billion planets. Others believe it could be anywhere from 200-300 billion. Using data from exoplanet-hunting missions such as Kepler, Gaia, and now James Webb, we can identify and confirm their existence. So, how many exoplanets have been discovered? These are the number of confirmed exoplanets and planetary systems by NASA, followed by the number of exoplanet candidates, which are discoveries that could be planets but are still unconfirmed by researchers. What is an exoplanet? An exoplanet is any planet orbiting a star outside of our solar system. Exoplanets can come in many different sizes and compositions. NASA categorizes the 5,241 confirmed exoplanets into 5 subtypes: Neptune-like, Super Earth, Gas Giant, Terrestrial, and the unknowns. Here’s how the space agency describes each: Neptune-like (1,919) These planets are Neptunian worlds, similar to Uranus or Neptune in our solar system. Super Earth (1,689) Super-Earths are exotic planets unlike any in our solar system–more massive than Earth yet lighter than gas giants like Neptune, and they can be made of gas, rock, or a combination of both. Gas Giant (1,786) These planets belong to a class known as gas giants, similar to Jupiter or Saturn in our solar system. How do we find them? Currently, there are 5 different methods scientists use to identify exoplanets. These include measuring tiny changes in a star’s brightness to looking for wobbling stars, usually caused by orbiting planets.

How many did they have? And were the planets like ours, or were they vastly different? Just thirty years ago, humanity was beginning to uncover the answers, as we started to discover planets in orbit around stars other than our own. At last, through a combination of multiple different methods ⁠— the radial velocity method, timing measurements, the transit method, and gravitational microlensing ⁠— we’ve surpassed 5000 known exoplanets: planets located beyond our own Solar System. As is often the case, these discoveries have been tremendous and have answered some of our deepest questions about the cosmos. Nevertheless, even deeper ones now remain. Here’s what we’ve learned so far. What do planets outside our solar system, or exoplanets, look like? A variety of possibilities are shown in this illustration. Scientists discovered the first exoplanets in the 1990s. As of 2024, the tally stands at over 5,000 confirmed exoplanets. None are known to be inhabited, but a few raise tantalizing possibilities: largely among the Earth-sized planets, but not so much among the larger ones. What is an exoplanet? In the early 1990s, two different methods, at almost the same time, started to reveal planets that were located beyond our own Solar System. Through measuring the periodic pulses coming from a neutron star, we could see that the pulses would regularly speed up, then return to normal speed, then slow down, and then return to normal speed again, over and over. The fact that these pulses changed with the same period and amplitude told us that there were massive companions in these pulsar systems, and by measuring the pulse timing, we could infer the masses of these companions: they were definitively planets. Similarly, we could observe the periodic redshifting and blueshifting of the light from individual stars, which also revealed the presence of massive planets, which “tugged”\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2022-03-24\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d7\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://science.nasa.gov/resource/video-nasa-confirms-5000-exoplanets-and-counting/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Video: NASA Confirms 5000 Exoplanets - and Counting There are billions of exoplanets in our galaxy alone, so many ... have now confirmed more than 5,000 exoplanets – planets beyond our solar system.

Exoplanets, worlds beyond the Solar System Highlights Scientists have discovered more than 5,000 planets outside of the Solar System, or âexoplanetsâ. Most stars in our galaxy have at least one exoplanet,Â and many are unlike any of the worlds in the Solar System. Some exoplanets could be habitable and are prime targets in the search for life beyond Earth. What are exoplanets? An exoplanet, short for âextrasolar planet,â is any planet that isnât in the Solar System. Some are gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn, some are rocky like Mercury or Mars, and others are icy like Neptune or Uranus. A select fraction â weâre not quite sure how many â could be like Earth, rocky and with liquid water on their surfaces. There are also many exoplanets that donât look like anything we have in the Solar System. One of the most common kinds of planets are âsuper-Earthsâ and âmini-Neptunesâ, so called because they are larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune. No world like this exists around the Sun. There are also planets, called âfree-floatingâ or ârogue planets,â that originally formed around a star but then got thrown out to drift through space alone. There are planets that orbit their host stars in hours, and there are planets that take millennia to go around once. There may be âwater worldsâ completely covered in oceans. And there are planetary systems, like TRAPPIST-1, where several planets are all packed into very close orbits around their star. Why study exoplanets? Are we alone? How did we get here? Every new exoplanet discovery provides important context to help answer these age-old questions.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

In particular, the Court’s decision does not affect the existing licensing regimes—known as “shall-issue” regimes—that are employed in 43 States… [2] Those shall-issue regimes may require a li­cense applicant to undergo fingerprinting, a background check, a mental health records check, and training in fire­arms handling and in laws regarding the use of force, among other possible requirements… Unlike New York’s may-issue regime, those shall-issue regimes do not grant open-ended discre­tion to licensing officials and do not require a showing of some special need apart from self-defense. As petitioners acknowledge, shall-issue licensing regimes are constitu­tionally permissible, subject of course to an as-applied chal­lenge if a shall-issue licensing regime does not operate in that manner in practice… [3]Second, as Heller and McDonald established and the Court today again explains, the Second Amendment “is neither a regulatory straightjacket nor a regulatory blank check.” … Properly interpreted, the Second Amendment allows a “variety” of gun regulations. [1] In 2020, 45,222 Americans were killed by firearms… Since the start of this year (2022), there have been 277 reported mass shootings—an average of more than one per day… Gun violence has now surpassed motor vehicle crashes as the leading cause of death among children and adolescents… Many States have tried to address some of the dangers of gun violence just described by passing laws that limit, in various ways, who may purchase, carry, or use firearms of different kinds. The Court today severely burdens States’ efforts to do so… [9] The question presented in this case concerns the extent to which the Second Amendment restricts different States (and the Federal Government) from working out solutions to these problems through democratic processes.

For example, the majority of the 19th-century courts to consider the question held that prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons were lawful under the Second Amendment or state analogues. See, e.g., State v. Chandler, 5 La. Ann., at 489–490; Nunn v. State, 1 Ga., at 251; see generally 2 Kent *340, n. 2; The American Students’ Blackstone 84, n. 11 (G. Chase ed. 1884). Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment , nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.26 We also recognize another important limitation on the right to keep and carry arms. Miller said, as we have explained, that the sorts of weapons protected were those “in common use at the time.” 307 U. S., at 179.

Bruen.44 In Bruen, two applicants for an unrestricted handgun carry license sued the superintendent of the New York State Police and a New York Supreme Court justice for violating their Second Amendment rights.45 The licensing officers denied their applications for failure to show “proper cause” for an unrestricted handgun carry license, as required by state law.46 Before reaching the merits, the Court declined to follow the two-step approach, holding that it was “one step too many.”47 The second step of the inquiry, which required interest balancing and means-end scrutiny, was “inconsistent with Heller’s historical approach.”48 The Court underscored that “the Constitution presumptively protects” individual conduct covered in “the Second Amendment’s plain text.”49 For a gun control regulation to pass constitutional muster, the government must demonstrate that it “is consistent with the Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation. ”50\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/4098803-judge-upholds-stringent-oregon-gun-control-law-as-constitutional/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Judge upholds stringent Oregon gun control law as constitutional ... A federal judge on Friday found Oregon’s new gun law — which bans large capacity magazines and requires residents to obtain a permit to purchase firearms – does not violate the Second Amendment. After a week-long trial, U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut in a 122-page order found that the law keeps up with “the nation’s history and tradition of regulating uniquely dangerous features of weapons and firearms to protect public safety.” The law, Measure 114, bans the sale, transfer and import of gun magazines with more than 10 rounds for residents that are not members of the military or law enforcement. The measure, however, will not require current gun owners with high-capacity magazines to turn over their firearms, but does bar them from removing the weapons from their home for anything other than practicing at a firing range, in shooting competitions or for hunting, according to the Associated Press. Guns with high-capacity magazines are “not commonly used for self-defense, and are therefore not protected by the Second Amendment,” Immergut wrote in her ruling. “The Second Amendment also allows governments to ensure that only law-abiding, responsible citizens keep and bear arms.” The lawsuit, filed in November by the Oregon Firearms Association, argued that the gun control law violated the Constitution. In response to Friday’s ruling, the group said it “wasn’t entirely unexpected.” “What we have read defies belief. While not entirely unexpected, Immergut’s ruling is simple nonsense and sure to be overturned at the 9th circuit,” the group wrote in a statement posted to their website. “When faced with the clear and undeniable issues about all magazines being banned and the permit system being completely unworkable, she essentially said ‘not my problem.'” “We are sure there will be plenty of parsing of this absurd decision in the coming days, but it was clear from the very first day that Immergut was both painfully ignorant and in the pocket of Oregon’s far left ‘Department of Justice,'” the organization added.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d5\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://jaapl.org/content/45/4/478\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Prohibition of Persons With Mental Illness From Gun Ownership ... The U.S. Supreme Court's landmark Heller1 and McDonald2 decisions shaped the contemporary legal understanding of gun rights in America, affirming that the Second Amendment to the Constitution confers the right for individuals to bear arms for personal protection but cautioning that the right is “not unlimited” (Ref. 1, p 626); longstanding gun prohibitions pertaining to certain categories of people, including “felons and the mentally ill” (Ref. 1, p 626; Ref. 2, p 786), remain presumptively legal. The Court thus preserved the 1968 Gun Control Act's prohibition of firearms sales to persons legally found to be dangerous or mentally “defective”3, a criterion that federal regulations and many state statutes have long defined as having a record of involuntary civil commitment or other mental-health–related adjudication.4Heller and McDonald implicitly left to future litigation the question of whether such a categorical restriction, one based on a mere record of past involuntary commitment, for example, might violate the constitutional rights of a prohibited person who later recovers from mental illness, commits no crimes, and poses no threat to public safety, yet is denied the opportunity to seek restoration.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d6\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://apnews.com/article/california-gun-politics-san-diego-b9a81a718cd16085604b9acaf3046f35\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Court: California's under-21 gun sales ban unconstitutional | AP News In a 2-1 ruling, a panel of the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Wednesday the law violates the Second Amendment right to bear arms and a San Diego judge should have blocked what it called “an almost total ban on semiautomatic centerfire rifles” for young adults. “America would not exist without the heroism of the young adults who fought and died in our revolutionary army,” Judge Ryan Nelson wrote. “Today we reaffirm that our Constitution still protects the right that enabled their sacrifice: the right of young adults to keep and bear arms.” The Firearms Policy Coalition, which brought the case, said the ruling makes it optimistic age-based gun bans will be overturned in other courts. Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the decision is a clear sign of how courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court which has a major gun case before it, are expanding gun rights. “Federal judges can read the tea leaves,” Winkler said. “In the coming years, the courts seem certain to strike down numerous gun safety measures in the name of the 2nd Amendment. This 9th Circuit ruling is a harbinger of things to come.” The ruling, however, was not a total victory for gun rights advocates. They also sought an injunction blocking the state from requiring a hunting license for adults under 21 — who are not in the military or law enforcement — to purchase rifles or shotguns. Handgun sales to those under 21 were already prohibited when the hunting license requirement was passed in 2018 after some of the nation’s worst mass shootings were committed by young adults using rifles, including the Valentine’s Day slayings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d7\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller\",\n    \"snippet\": \"District of Columbia v.

In most cases the gun safety law or criminal conviction at issue has been however upheld by the lower courts.[74][75] Provided with only minimum guidance from the Supreme Court in Heller the lower courts were tasked with defining the scope of the Second Amendment rights and the proper standard of review for evaluating Second Amendment claims in the aforementioned cases.[76] The courts have upheld most of the above-mentioned laws as being constitutional.[73] The basis for the lower court rulings is the dicta in the paragraph near the end of the Heller ruling that states: Nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions on the commercial sale of arms.[77] Consistently since the Heller ruling, the lower federal courts have ruled that almost all gun control measures as presently legislated are lawful and that according to UCLA professor of constitutional law Adam Winkler: \\\"What gun rights advocates are discovering is that the vast majority of gun control laws fit within these categories.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  }\n]\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"verdict\": \"partially supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"The snippet states that the Second Amendment allows a variety of gun regulations and that shall-issue licensing regimes are constitutionally permissible.\",\n    \"quote\": \"Properly interpreted, the Second Amendment allows a “variety” of gun regulations. ... shall-issue licensing regimes are constitu­tionally permissible, subject of course to an as-applied chal­lenge if a shall-issue licensing regime does not operate in that manner in practice.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"It discusses constitutional limits and permissible gun regulations but does not directly state whether gun control legislation violates the Second Amendment overall.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"high\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"verdict\": \"partially supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"The Supreme Court in District of Columbia v.

Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only. This is not an hard-and-fast reasoning ladder, the most important thing for you is to STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE CONFLICT TAXONOMY in order to decide the final conflict type label. \n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose that other label. Also adhere strictly to the CONFLICT TAXONOMY STATED ABOVE.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (STRICT)\n==============================\n\nFor a given conflict type, the final answer must adhere to a specific behaviour defined in the rules below:\n\n- \"Conflict due to outdated information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict due to misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only.

The third Pacte de Famille, 1761 The third Family Compact was made on 15 August 1761 by King Charles III of Spain and Louis XV in the Treaty of Paris, during the Seven Years' War, which had up to this point involved France but not Spain. Charles III was the son of Philip V, making him Louis's first cousin. Charles's alliance reversed the policy of his predecessor, Ferdinand VI, who wished to keep Spain out of the war. With Ferdinand's death in August 1759 his half-brother Charles, the oldest son of Elisabeth Farnese, ascended to the Spanish throne. He had already ruled the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily for nearly twenty-five years. In 1742 during the War of the Austrian Succession, Ferdinand attempted to use his Sicilian domains to assist his Bourbon allies, but a Royal Navy fleet led by CommodoreWilliam Martin intervened to ensure his neutrality.[6] The Seven Years' War was going badly for the French, so the chief minister, Etienne François, duc de Choiseul pursued a dual track policy of attempting to bring Spain into a third pacte de famille or sue Britain and its allies for peace. Charles III was worried about the vulnerability of the overseas portion of his empire, and also worried that France would sell out Spain's interests in a peace with Britain. A formal alliance would prevent France concluding a peace unilaterally, so opted for the alliance with France, with the two Bourbon monarchies agreeing to settle the conflict with Britain in concert with each other. The pacte was to go into effect after the annual silver Spanish treasure fleet had arrived in Spain, signalling to the British that Spain intended on entering the conflict.[7][8] The agreement involved Spain's allies, ruled by cadet branches of the Spanish Bourbons; Naples and Parma.

Both England and France sought Spanish support in the Seven Years War, but England's attack on Spanish colonies and shipping alienated Charles III of Spain and the king rejected the English offer in favor of the proposal made by the French minister, the duc de Choiseul. The pact, which dealt with political and commercial relations and with the entry of Spain into the war, also included the Bourbon ruler of the Two Sicilies and the Infante Philip, duke of Parma.

Because of his close relationship with Louis XV their alliance became known as the Family Compact. Louis failed to restore Stanislas to the Polish throne, but the Bourbons would gain the Duchy of Lorraine (for France) and the Kingdoms of Naples and Sicily (for Charles, the third son of King Philip V of Spain) from his conflict.

Â A second major misunderstanding lay in the British perception that although they had neglected to enforce various import and export restrictions for decades, the colonists would understand their responsibilities as parts of the empire and readily conform to new and stricter controls. By 1760 smuggling had become a major American enterprise. Â Given that it was expensive to maintain revenue cutters and other patrol vessels along a thinly populated American coast filled with many bays, inlets, and rivers in which vessels could hide themselves, the British had found it far from cost-effective to try to enforce navigation laws. Â In 1761 the British began to reinforce writs of assistance, laws that granted customs officials the authority to conduct random searches of property to seek out goods on which required duties had not been paid, not only in public establishments but in private homes. Â Representing New Englandâs merchants, attorney James Otis protested against these general warrants, proclaiming that âa manâs house is his castle,â and that violating its sanctity was a âwanton exerciseâ of power.

Â Understandably wishing to reduce the cost of maintaining its empire, the British felt that if the North Americans would not interfere with the Indians, guarding of the frontiers would be less demanding and far less costly. Â Thus in 1763 a royal proclamation was issued that reserved all of the western territory between the Allegheny Mountains and the Mississippi for use by the Indians. Â The colonists, now that the French were no longer present to rile and equip the Indians, saw the vast open reaches beyond the mountains as greener pastures to which they were entitled. Â The proclamation was thus seen as high-handed and uncalled for. Between 1763 and 1766 Pontiac's Rebellion took place in the Great Lakes region.

The first document on the reel was a Peace and Friendship Treaty signed between the “Jediack tribe of Indians” and the British government at Nova Scotia. It was part of a series of treaties that were signed in 1760 and 1761, though the entirety of the Peace and Friendship Treaties encompass the years from 1725 to 1799. The treaties in 1760/61 were signed at a time of great upheaval and change in the colonies of Nova Scotia, as well as in the colony of Quebec. For a long period of time the French had inhabited Nova Scotia (Acadia) and had established productive trading relations and alliances with the Indigenous peoples in Nova Scotia, especially the various bands of the Mi’kmaq. Years prior in 1713, the Treaty of Utrecht had been signed between Britain and France. Along with other concessions, the French ceded Acadia but kept part of the territory (what is now New Brunswick) and Ile Royale (Cape Breton). The French began building the Fortress of Louisbourg on Cape Breton shortly after this. When war and conflict broke out, as the British and French continually tried to assert dominance in this region, the Indigenous peoples most often sided with the French. The Seven Years War began in 1756 (also referred to as the French and Indian War in North America), and this pattern of alliance was no different. The North American front of the war was fought between the British and the French, heavily aided by Indigenous allies, hence the name “French and Indian War.” At first, the war looked to be in favour of the French, but in 1758 with the final capture and destruction of Louisbourg on Ile Royale (Cape Breton), the British quickly capitalized on their victory, gaining control of Quebec City in 1759 and then Montreal in 1760.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn the dataset which you are being shown, true “Conflict due to misinformation” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflict due to outdated information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”, choose that other label instead in such case.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation almost always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation conflict type label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (STRICT AND ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this way: try to assign one of : “No conflict” or “Complementary information” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No conflict\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports refer to the same concept and agree; i.e. if differences between them are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary information\n   Definition: All documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports complement each other in terms of the information they provide. Another case is when the question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers (contradicting each other) for the SAME scope and time (example : A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; look for “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation” or \"Outdated\" types.\n\n3) Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\n   Definition: SOME OR ALL documents which are marked supports and/or partially supports contradict or conflict each other (or disagree with each other) in terms of the information they provide. They involve opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider other types of conflicts.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict due to outdated information\n   Definition: This is when there is a temporal conflict among the documents (more recent docs conflict with/condratict older docs). A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict due to misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most (but not all) conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (To be used along with CONFLICT TAXONOMY)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using the conflict taxonomy defined above and ONLY IF NEEDED use this thinking ladder as well:\n\n    • A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • B: If explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements WITHOUT ANY CONTRADICTION → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • C: If there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • D: If newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    Even though we have defined a reasoning ladder here, it is not always necessary that you should think in this specific order only.

A study using employee monitoring software confirmed that the shift to remote work during COVID improved productivity by 5%. In a University of Chicago research paper, scientists found that nearly six in ten of their survey respondents reported higher productivity when working remotely, while only 14% proved less productive. On average, remote work productivity was over 7% higher than in-office productivity. That shouldn’t be surprising. A major benefit from remote work comes from doing away with the daily commute. Workers on average devote approximately 35% of their saved time from not commuting to their primary job, according to research at the University of Chicago. Given that people spend an average of nearly an hour per day on commute travel alone, and additional time on other commute-related tasks, this adds up to substantial additional time worked. Indeed, a research study from Harvard University published in the National Bureau of Economic Research finds a large increase in the amount of time worked by remote workers compared to in-office workers. Evaluating the impact of the lockdowns in 16 large cities in North America, Europe, and the Middle East on knowledge workers, the researchers found an increase in the average workday of 8.2%, or 48.5 minutes. Another benefit stems from greater flexibility to do work tasks at times that work for us. We know from research that all of us have different levels of energy throughout the day when we are best suited for various activities that don’t necessarily match the typical rhythms of a 9-5 schedule. By doing specific work tasks at various times, we can get more done. And more recent research showed that remote work productivity actually increased throughout the pandemic. Stanford University researchers doing a longitudinal study comparing productivity at different time periods found that remote workers were 5% more efficient than office-based ones in the summer of 2020. But this number improved to 9% by summer 2022. Why? Because all of us learned how to be better at remote work. And really, are workers all that productive in the office?

Remote-work technology goes mainstream The widespread implementation of remote-working technology, a defining feature of the pandemic, is another important factor for productivity. This technology will boost work-from-home productivity by 46 percent by the end of the pandemic, relative to the pre-pandemic situation, according to a model developed by Rutgers’s Morris A. Davis, University of North Carolina’s Andra C. Ghent, and University of Wisconsin’s Jesse M. Gregory. “While many home-office technologies have been around for a while, the technologies become much more useful after widespread adoption,” the researchers note. There are significant costs to leaving the office, Rutgers’s Davis says, pointing to the loss of face-to-face interaction, among other things. “Working at home is always less productive than working at the office. Always,” he said on a June episode of the Freakonomics podcast. One reason, he says, has to do with the function of cities as business centers. “Cities exist because, we think, the crowding of employment makes everyone more productive,” he explains. “This idea also applies to firms: a firm puts all workers on the same floor of a building, or all in the same suite rather than spread throughout a building, for reasons of efficiency. It is easier to communicate and share ideas with office mates, which leads to more productive outcomes.” While some employees are more productive at home, that’s not the case overall, according to the model, which after calibration “implies that the average high-skill worker is less productive at home than at the office, even postpandemic,” he says. How remote work could change city centers What will happen to urban business districts and the cities in which they are located in the age of increasing remote work?

And more executives agree: over half (52%) say average employee productivity has improved vs. 44% who said the same in June. Also, employees who report higher productivity are much more likely to say their companies have been better at performing various activities, including collaborating on new projects and serving customers. Remote work productivity is not just a fleeting crisis phenomenon. Findings from this second survey should help dispel concerns among the skeptics that work-from-home (WFH) is less effective. Instead, this data should draw attention to specific actions companies can take to help their workforce perform effectively in any environment. A majority of employees surveyed say their companies have been successful in finding ways to make WFH more productive. Allowing the flexibility needed to manage family matters is rated highest: 79% of employees say it’s been a success. Companies that may have been slow to adopt technologies that support remote work — or to create clear rules and a secure structure around WFH — are playing catch-up. Optimizing the hybrid workplace requires accelerating investments to support virtual collaboration and creativity, as well as for scheduling and safety. Over 60% of executives expect to raise spending on virtual collaboration tools and manager training.

A McKinsey study shows that between in-office or remote working, 87% of employees prefer working remotely.

And there are facts to prove it. 5 Trends Emerging From the Rise in Remote Work As remote work becomes the new normal, it’s not just employees’ professional and personal lives that are affected. The working world is shifting, and companies need to adapt to ensure their remote workers remain engaged and productive. Here are five key trends shaping the new world of work and what they mean for remote workers’ productivity: Rise in Coworking Spaces The remote work boom has resulted in a remarkable expansion of available coworking spaces. Research and Markets anticipates the global coworking spaces market to grow by $14,124.67 million between 2022 and 2027, and the rising number of freelancers, startups, and remote employees looking for professional workspaces will propel this growth. Unsurprisingly, companies searching for flexible office space solutions are also getting in on the coworking trend. Not only are coworking spaces beneficial for remote work productivity, but they also provide a sense of community and collaboration among remote workers. Reinvention of the Office A Harvard Business Review article highlights the transformation of offices into collaborative social spaces that foster employee well-being and productivity. Companies are also investing in technology and digital tools to facilitate communication and collaboration among remote teams. Global Talent Acquisition Remote work has made it easier for companies to access talent from anywhere in the world. This can lead to increased innovation, creativity, and improved employee performance. Many companies are taking advantage of this by hiring remote workers from other countries.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d6\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.gallup.com/workplace/283985/working-remotely-effective-gallup-research-says-yes.aspx\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Is Working Remotely Effective? Gallup Research Says Yes It's probable that, between the higher engagement and increased productivity of remote work, off-site workers offer leaders the greatest gains in business outcomes. And those outcomes are significant. For example, in a 500-employee company where employees work remotely three days a week, if employees at a company with an average engagement rate improved productivity by 5% by working remotely, the company would save approximately $3,000 per employee. But the engaged -- who create an average 15% productivity bump -- would save the company up to $8,000 per employee. That's an annual $4 million premium. That said, marked differences exist between workers who are remote part of the time and workers who are remote 100% of the time and between employees with differing job functions. These distinctions should factor into the math of flexible policies. Remote Work Affects Your Environmental Impact Remote work influences the environment, which should be an aspect of any environmentally-focused corporate social responsibility program and may fit environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria. The variables are fairly complex, though. A business could consider issues such as solid waste disposal -- people use far more paper in the office than at home -- reduced energy use (on-site workers use twice as much electricity as home-based employees), even the effects of maintenance products on air pollution. The easiest way to measure a company's carbon footprint, however, is by the mile -- and every mile a worker doesn't drive improves the company's environmental impact. For instance, Sun Microsystems' Open Work Program, which permitted 24,000 U.S. employees to work from home, prevented the release of 32,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide into the environment that year. In 2015, Xerox reported that its remote workers drove 92 million fewer miles, which reduced carbon dioxide emissions by nearly 41,000 metric tons.

Companies and managers need to provide their teams with the tools and resources to be productive and successful in their home environment, and carry the lessons learned from remote work during COVID-19 into the business plan moving forward. Closing Closing Whether you were ready for it or not, the future of work is here. Also, something we like to call the Work From Anywhere movement. Our lives will be forever changed due to COVID-19 and its implications, and what we’ve learned in our annual report is the time is now to embrace remote work and hybrid teams. We now know the deep connection video can provide. We know that employee expectations have shifted. We know that remote work can be as, if not more, productive than being in-office. And we know that employers need to pay attention in order to maintain employee productivity, and to continue to retain and recruit top talent. Your business now has a remote workforce with different needs, and companies that will ultimately succeed will embrace and benefit from it. It’s time to rethink the way you work, and rethink the products, tools and strategies currently in place, or need to employ to better support remote work and hybrid teams.

When job losses disproportionately occur in low-productivity sectors, such as service work — as has happened during the pandemic — that can also boost overall productivity figures. Nonetheless, some economists have calculated that a substantial shift toward a working-from-home economy could result in a permanent increase in productivity, perhaps because of reduced commuting and fewer of the distractions that can come with office life. But we don’t think that’s likely. Research suggests that a switch to permanent remote work would make us all less productive. People who shift to working from home can temporarily increase the amount of work they get done in a given day. But over the medium to long term, long-distance employment can’t deliver key benefits — including learning and new friendships — that come from face-to-face contact. In-person work fosters innovation, the effects of which on productivity almost certainly exceed the gains from working harder at home for possibly unsustainable stretches. An even slightly higher growth rate once people return to offices will quickly outpace the one-time gain from saved commuting time. None of this is to say that all white-collar workers should return to the office five days a week. The pandemic will surely hasten a move toward a hybrid model that involves some days at home and some in the office, giving workers welcome new flexibility. Still, it’s important to understand the downsides of the working-from-home economy. Research has long linked inequality with reduced economic growth, and working from home will make society more unequal. In May 2020, when more than two-thirds of Americans with advanced degrees were telecommuting, less than 15 percent of Americans with only a high school degree or less were doing so. But there are divisions even among white-collar workers: The remote world may seem heavenly for middle-aged professionals with extensive networks of colleagues and comfortable home offices, for example, but it is decidedly less appealing for 20-somethings who are trying to find their way in a new company and to get work done in dark, cramped apartments. As time passes, those workers may find it harder to land promotions and to thrive more generally.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d9\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://hbr.org/2020/11/our-work-from-anywhere-future\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Our Work-from-Anywhere Future Our Work-from-Anywhere Future The pandemic has hastened a rise in remote working for knowledge-based organizations. This has notable benefits: Companies can save on real estate costs, hire and utilize talent globally, mitigate immigration issues, and experience productivity gains, while workers can enjoy geographic flexibility. At the same time, concerns include how to communicate across time zones, share knowledge that isn’t yet codified, socialize virtually and prevent professional isolation, protect client data, and avoid slacking. Research into work-from-anywhere (WFA) organizations and groups that include the United States Patent and Trademark Office, Tata Consultancy Services, and GitLab (the world’s largest all-remote company) highlights best practices and can help leaders decide whether remote work is right for their organizations. Idea in Brief The Shift The Covid-19 lockdowns proved that it is not only possible but perhaps preferable for knowledge workers to do their jobs from anywhere. Will this mark a long-term shift into all-remote work? Benefits and Challenges Studies show that working from home yields numerous benefits for both individuals and their organizations, most notably in the form of enhanced productivity and engagement. But when all or most employees are remote, challenges arise for communication, knowledge sharing, socialization, performance evaluation, security, and more. The Research As more companies adopt work-from-anywhere policies, best practices are emerging. The experiences of GitLab, Tata Consultancy Services, Zapier, and others show how the risks associated with this type of work can be overcome. Before 2020 a movement was brewing within knowledge-work organizations. Personal technology and digital connectivity had advanced so far and so fast that people had begun to ask, “Do we really need to be together, in an office, to do our work?” We got our answer during the pandemic lockdowns. We learned that a great many of us don’t in fact need to be colocated with colleagues on-site to do our jobs.

Since 2020, many will have become adept at using Zoom, Webex, Teams or Slack. But another cost may rise over time: the underdevelopment of human capital. In a study of software engineers published in April, Drs Emanuel and Harrington, along with Amanda Pallais, also of Harvard, found that feedback exchanged between colleagues dropped sharply after the move to remote work. Drs Atkin, Schoar and Shinde documented a relative decline in learning for workers at home. Those in offices picked up skills more quickly. The origins of the view that, contrary to the above, remote working boosts productivity can be traced to an experiment nearly a decade before the pandemic, which was reported by Nicholas Bloom of Stanford and others in 2013. Call-centre workers for a Chinese online travel agency now known as Trip.com increased their performance by 13% when remote—a figure that continues to appear in media coverage today. But two big wrinkles are often neglected: first, more than two-thirds of the improved performance came from employees working longer hours, not more efficiently; second, the Chinese firm eventually halted remote work because off-site employees struggled to get promoted. In 2022 Dr Bloom visited Trip.com again, this time to investigate the effects of a hybrid-working trial. The outcomes of this experiment were less striking: it had a negligible impact on productivity, though workers put in longer days and wrote more code when in the office. The price of happiness There is more to work (and life) than productivity. Perhaps the greatest virtue of remote work is that it leads to happier employees. People spend less time commuting, which from their vantage-point might feel like an increase in productivity, even if conventional measures fail to detect it. They can more easily fit in school pickups and doctor appointments, not to mention the occasional lie-in or midmorning jog. And some tasks—notably, those requiring unbroken concentration for long periods—can often be done more smoothly from home than in open-plan offices. All this explains why so many workers have become so office-shy.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d11\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://fortune.com/2023/07/06/remote-workers-less-productive-wfh-research/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Fully remote workers are officially less productive | Fortune Remote work, for millions of employees, has long gone from a nice-to-have to a must-have; 40% of U.S. employees currently work remotely for at least one day a week. That figure comes from WFH Research, led by professors Jose Maria Barrero, Nicholas Bloom, and Steven J. Davis. They’ve been surveying Americans’ working arrangements since May 2020, becoming one of the ultimate authorities on remote work. The researchers have long maintained that some form of flexible work is the only way forward for most workplaces (“In 2023, we’ll be laughing at anyone who does anything else but hybrid,” Bloom told Fortunelast fall). But their latest working paper, published by Stanford’s Institute for Economic Policy and Research, delivers a blow to work-from-home advocates: Fully remote work is associated with 10% to 20% lower productivity than fully in-person work. Bosses have long been suspecting that their remote workers are less productive; worker productivity has been plummeting for five straight quarters, for the first time since World War II. It’s why so many Fortune 500 CEOs, from David Solomon to Mark Zuckerberg to Marc Benioff, have been ordering their workers back to the office, hoping it would improve their bottom lines—and morale. But those daunting percentages aren’t the result of remote workers simply being lazy or slacking off, meaning a full-time return to office may not necessarily fix the problem. Drawing on various studies from across the globe, Barrero, Bloom, and Davis wrote that challenges in communicating remotely and lack of motivation are the main issues preventing fully remote workers from being more productive. “Supervising, training, mentoring, and building firm culture is much harder” with fully remote workers than with workers who come in a few times per week, Barrero tells Fortune. Distributed communications—and explaining or clarifying things virtually that would be much simpler in person—tend to crowd out productive work time.

[d2] Several high-credibility sources, including Gallup and PwC, report that remote work can increase engagement and productivity, with many employees and executives noting improved performance compared to pre-pandemic levels [d3][d6][d9]. However, other research finds that fully remote work may reduce productivity by 10–20% or that high-skill workers perform better in the office, suggesting outcomes depend on job type and work arrangement [d2][d8][d10][d11]. Low-credibility sources also frequently claim large productivity gains for remote workers, but these findings are less reliable [d1][d4][d5][d7].\n[[END-OF-ANSWER]]"}]}
