Inputs:

- query:
{query}

- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):
{retrieved_docs}

- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):
{per_doc_notes}

- GIVEN conflict_type (gold label for this example), wrapped in tags:
<CONFLICT_LABEL>{conflict_type}</CONFLICT_LABEL>

Task:
1) Follow the full OUTPUT CONTRACT exactly, in ORACLE-CONFLICT mode.

   • Treat the GIVEN conflict_type as ground truth.
     - It is provided between <CONFLICT_LABEL> and </CONFLICT_LABEL>.
     - You MUST NOT choose, correct, or substitute a different label.
     - You MUST COPY this text exactly when you write the label line.

   • In your <think> block:

       (A) Produce a VALID JSON array entry for EVERY doc d1…dN (order-preserving, one object per doc; if verdict=="irrelevant" set key_fact="").

       (B) Write conflict reasoning FIRST: cluster docs, reference doc IDs, and NAME a mechanism (temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive). This reasoning must be consistent with the GIVEN conflict_type.

       (C) Output ONE label line:
           <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>

           Where:
           - <ConflictType> is EXACTLY the text from <CONFLICT_LABEL>…</CONFLICT_LABEL> in the input.
           - You may NOT rephrase, shorten, or “fix” this label.
           - You ONLY invent the <concise conflict_reason> (≤50 words).

       (D) Add brief reasoning connecting evidence to the final answer (or abstention).

   • After </think>, output ONE blank line.

   • Then output the final answer (or exactly "CANNOT ANSWER, INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE" if abstaining).

   • End with the sentinel line [[END-OF-ANSWER]].

Reminders (DO NOT PRINT):
- You are not deciding or choosing the conflict type; you are using the GIVEN conflict type label (VERBATIM) from <CONFLICT_LABEL>…</CONFLICT_LABEL> and making all of your reasoning and answer consistent with it.
- Do NOT change the label, even if your own interpretation of the docs would prefer another conflict type.
- Conflict taxonomy options (for background only, NOT for choosing labels): No conflict / Complementary information / Conflicting opinions or research outcomes / Conflict due to outdated information / Conflict due to misinformation.
- Use only existing doc_ids in bracketed citations [dX]; no ranges like d1–d5; never cite out-of-bounds [dK].
- Prefer high-credibility sources and order citations high→low in the evidence list.
- If any doc is "supports" or "partially supports", DO NOT abstain.
- Close </think> before the answer; no extra text outside the required format.
