Inputs:

- query:
{query}

- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):
{retrieved_docs}

Task:
1) Follow the full OUTPUT CONTRACT exactly.
   • <think> block with:
       (A) VALID JSON array for EVERY doc d1…dN (order-preserving, one object per doc; if verdict=="irrelevant" set key_fact="")
       (B) Conflict reasoning FIRST: cluster docs, reference doc IDs, and NAME the mechanism (temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive)
       (C) ONE label line: "<ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>"
       (D) Brief reasoning connecting evidence to the final answer (or abstention)
   • ONE blank line
   • Final answer (or exactly "CANNOT ANSWER, INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE" if abstaining)
   • Final sentinel line [[END-OF-ANSWER]].

Reminders (DO NOT PRINT):
- Conflict taxonomy (strict): No conflict / Complementary information / Conflicting opinions or research outcomes / Conflict due to outdated information / Conflict due to misinformation.
- Apply the decision ladder in this order: No conflict → Complementary information → Conflicting opinions or research outcomes → Conflict due to outdated information → Conflict due to misinformation (last resort).
- Use only existing doc_ids in bracketed citations [dX]; no ranges like d1–d5; never cite out-of-bounds [dK].
- Prefer high-credibility sources and order citations high→low in the evidence list.
- If any doc is "supports" or "partially supports", DO NOT abstain.
- Close </think> before the answer; no extra text outside the required format.
