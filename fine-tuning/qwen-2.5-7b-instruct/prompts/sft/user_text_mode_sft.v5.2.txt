Inputs:

- query:
{query}

- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):
{retrieved_docs}

- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):
{per_doc_notes}

Task:
Follow the OUTPUT CONTRACT specified in the system message exactly.

1) Produce a <think> block that contains:
   (A) A VALID JSON array for EVERY doc d1…dN (order-preserving, one object per doc; if verdict=="irrelevant" set key_fact="").
   (B) Conflict reasoning FIRST: cluster docs by agreement/time/scope/method, reference doc IDs, and NAME the main divergence mechanism (temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive).
   (C) ONE label line: "<ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>" where ConflictType is one of:
       "No conflict", "Complementary information", "Conflicting opinions or research outcomes",
       "Conflict due to outdated information", "Conflict due to misinformation".
   (D) Brief reasoning connecting the evidence to the final answer (or abstention).

2) After </think>, write ONE blank line, then:
   • If abstaining: output exactly:
     CANNOT ANSWER, INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE
   • Otherwise: write the final answer in 2–4 sentences (4–5 for simple unanimous facts), with [dX] citations on almost all sentences.
   • End with the sentinel line:
     [[END-OF-ANSWER]]

Reminders (DO NOT PRINT):
- Use only valid doc_ids d1…dN in citations; no ranges and no out-of-bounds IDs.
- Respect the conflict taxonomy and decision process from the system message, especially rules for:
  • distinguishing “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” vs “Conflict due to outdated information”,
  • treating “Conflict due to misinformation” as a last-resort label.
- If any doc is "supports" or "partially supports", DO NOT abstain.
- Do not add any extra text before <think>, between </think> and the answer, or after [[END-OF-ANSWER]].
