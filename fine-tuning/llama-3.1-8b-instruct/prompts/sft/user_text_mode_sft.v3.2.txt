Inputs:

- query:
{query}

- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):
{retrieved_docs}

- per_doc_notes (one per doc_id: verdict, key_fact, quote (optional), verdict_reason, source_quality):
{per_doc_notes}

Task:
1) Predict the conflict_type and write EXACTLY one sentence:
   <ConflictType> — <conflict_reason>   (use only the allowed labels; ≤ 50 words; no long doc-ID lists)
2) Follow the OUTPUT CONTRACT exactly:
   • <think> block with:
       (A) Valid JSON array for EVERY doc d1…dN (order-preserving; if verdict=="irrelevant" set key_fact="")
       (B) ONE conflict line "<ConflictType> — <conflict_reason>" (clustered phrasing, no ranges like d1–d5)
       (C) Brief reasoning that connects evidence to the final answer (or abstention)
   • ONE blank line
   • Final answer (or exactly "CANNOT ANSWER, INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE" if abstaining)
   • Final sentinel line [[END-OF-ANSWER]].

Reminders (DO NOT PRINT):
- Use the decision gates in order; if none fire and facets are not explicit, DEFAULT to "No conflict".
- "Outdated" REQUIRES visible dates/recency indicating newer supersedes older; otherwise do NOT choose it.
- "Misinformation" REQUIRES contradiction with high-cred sources; do not speculate.
- Only cite existing doc_ids [dX]; no ranges or out-of-bounds citations.
- Lead with high-cred evidence in the final answer; integrate lower-cred corroboration carefully.
- Close </think> before the answer; nothing extra outside the required format.
