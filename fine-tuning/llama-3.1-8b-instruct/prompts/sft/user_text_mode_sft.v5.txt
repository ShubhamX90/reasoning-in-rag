Inputs:

- query:
{query}

- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):
{retrieved_docs}

- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):
{per_doc_notes}

Task:
1) Follow the full OUTPUT CONTRACT exactly.
   • <think> block with:
       (A) VALID JSON array for EVERY doc d1…dN (order-preserving, one object per doc; if verdict=="irrelevant" set key_fact="")
       (B) Conflict reasoning FIRST: cluster docs, reference doc IDs, and NAME the mechanism (temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive)
       (C) ONE label line: "<ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>"
       (D) Brief reasoning connecting evidence to the final answer (or abstention)
   • ONE blank line
   • Final answer (or exactly "CANNOT ANSWER, INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE" if abstaining)
   • Final sentinel line [[END-OF-ANSWER]].

Reminders (DO NOT PRINT):
- Think in this order when choosing the conflict label:
  1) Try "No conflict" if all non-irrelevant docs agree up to wording/rounding.
  2) Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain different but compatible statements → "Complementary information".
  3) Else, if there are incompatible claims in the same scope/time and you cannot say which side is correct → "Conflicting opinions or research outcomes".
  4) Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps clearly supersede older factual claims → "Conflict due to outdated information".
  5) ONLY if you can prove from the snippets that some doc states a fact refuted by more reliable docs in the set → "Conflict due to misinformation".
- “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” are rare; if you are unsure, choose a non-misinformation label.
- Conflict taxonomy (strict): No conflict / Complementary information / Conflicting opinions or research outcomes / Conflict due to outdated information / Conflict due to misinformation.
- Use only existing doc_ids in bracketed citations [dX]; no ranges like d1–d5; never cite out-of-bounds [dK].
- Prefer high-credibility sources and order citations high→low in the evidence list.
- If any doc is "supports" or "partially supports", DO NOT abstain.
- Close </think> before the answer; no extra text outside the required format.
