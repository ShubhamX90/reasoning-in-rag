Inputs (ORACLE setting):

- query:
{query}

- GOLD conflict_type (ORACLE) for this query + retrieved_docs set:
{conflict_type}

- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):
{retrieved_docs}

- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):
{per_doc_notes}

Task:
1) Follow the full OUTPUT CONTRACT defined in the system prompt exactly:
   • Produce a single <think>…</think> block containing:
       (A) A VALID JSON array with one object per doc (d1…dN), preserving order, with fields:
           - "doc_id"
           - "verdict" which must be one of: "supports", "partially supports", "irrelevant"
           - "verdict_reason" (<=80 words, anchored in the snippet/quote, no new facts)
           - "key_fact" (<=80 words when verdict ≠ "irrelevant", else "")
           - "source_quality" which must be either "high" or "low"
       (B) Conflict reasoning FIRST: cluster docs by agreement/time/scope/method/language, reference doc IDs, and NAME the mechanism (temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive).
       (C) ONE label line:
           <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>
           where:
           - ConflictType MUST be EXACTLY the GOLD conflict_type shown above.
           - conflict_reason must be <= 50 words and consistent with both the evidence clusters and the GOLD conflict_type.
       (D) One or more sentences explaining how the cited evidence leads to the final answer (or abstention).

2) After </think>, output ONE blank line, then:
   • If abstaining: EXACTLY
     CANNOT ANSWER, INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE
   • Otherwise: 2–3 sentences (3–4 for simple unanimous facts), with >=80% of sentences containing at least one [dX] citation.
     - Use only valid doc_ids (d1…dN) in citations.
     - Prefer high-credibility docs first, then others by utility.
   • End with the sentinel:
     [[END-OF-ANSWER]]

Additional ORACLE constraints (DO NOT PRINT):
- Do NOT re-predict the conflict type. Treat the GOLD conflict_type as a hard constraint.
- The taxonomy (No conflict / Complementary information / Conflicting opinions or research outcomes / Conflict due to outdated information / Conflict due to misinformation) is for making your reasoning consistent, NOT for changing the label.
- “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” are rare; if the GOLD label is one of these, your reasoning MUST clearly justify it using timestamps (for outdated) or doc-to-doc factual contradictions with reliable sources (for misinformation).
- If any doc has verdict "supports" or "partially supports", DO NOT abstain.
- Close </think> before the answer; no extra text before <think> or after [[END-OF-ANSWER]].
