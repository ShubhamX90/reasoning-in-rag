If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Bains considered various scenarios that could produce phosphine, such as sunlight, surface minerals, volcanic activity, a meteor strike, and lightning. Ranjan along with Paul Rimmer of Cambridge University then modeled how phosphine produced through these mechanisms could accumulate in the Venusian clouds. In every scenario they considered, the phosphine produced would only amount to a tiny fraction of what the new observations suggest is present on Venus’ clouds. “We really went through all possible pathways that could produce phosphine on a rocky planet,” Petkowski says. “If this is not life, then our understanding of rocky planets is severely lacking.” A life in the clouds If there is indeed life in Venus’ clouds, the researchers believe it to be an aerial form, existing only in Venus’ temperate cloud deck, far above the boiling, volcanic surface. “A long time ago, Venus is thought to have oceans, and was probably habitable like Earth,” Sousa-Silva says. “As Venus became less hospitable, life would have had to adapt, and they could now be in this narrow envelope of the atmosphere where they can still survive. This could show that even a planet at the edge of the habitable zone could have an atmosphere with a local aerial habitable envelope.” In a separate line of research, Seager and Petkowski have explored the possibility that the lower layers of Venus’ atmosphere, just below the cloud deck, could be crucial for the survival of a hypothetical Venusian biosphere. “You can, in principle, have a life cycle that keeps life in the clouds perpetually,” says Petkowski, who envisions any aerial Venusian life to be fundamentally different from life on Earth. “The liquid medium on Venus is not water, as it is on Earth.” Sousa-Silva is now leading an effort with Jason Dittman at MIT to further confirm the phosphine detection with other telescopes.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://news.wisc.edu/life-could-be-thriving-in-the-clouds-of-venus/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Life could be thriving in the clouds of Venus Life could be thriving in the clouds of Venus Is there life on Venus? For more than a century, scientists have pondered this question. Now, there is renewed interest in Venus as a place that could support living organisms. “We are trying to make the case for exploring Venus and to inspire and inform future missions to collect in situ data with satellites,” says Sanjay Limaye, a University of Wisconsin–Madison Space Science and Engineering Center scientist and co-author of a recent collection of papers on Venus that he hopes will do just that. Venus is a planet of extremes with surface temperatures in excess of 900 degrees Fahrenheit and pressures 90 times those of Earth. PLANET-C Project Team Limaye is an expert on Venus. With more than 45 years of research behind him, he continues to investigate the planet’s dense atmosphere. “As one of our closest neighbors it is easier to reach Venus compared to other bodies like Titan, Enceladus or even Mars,” he says. Published in 2021 in the journal Astrobiology, the series of articles targets Venus as a potential home for microbial life like bacteria and other organisms. The collection emerged from the 2019 Venera-D Venus Cloud Habitability workshop, which convened more than 50 scientists in Moscow to examine existing research and understand the planet’s potential to support life billions of years ago — and today. Formed around the same time as Earth, about 4.5 billion years ago, Venus occupies an orbit between Mercury and Earth. The planet rotates very slowly on its axis, taking 243 Earth days to complete a single rotation. Its massive atmosphere of mostly carbon dioxide makes it a planet of extremes, with scorching temperatures, intense winds and volcanic activity. Despite the features that make the planet’s surface inhospitable, its thick global cloud cover may present gentler conditions for some microbial life forms due to the availability of sunlight, nutrients and some water — all of which can create narrow but habitable zones like those theorized to exist high in the atmosphere.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.universetoday.com/162086/the-clouds-of-venus-could-support-life/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"The Clouds of Venus Could Support Life - Universe Today The Clouds of Venus Could Support Life A recent study published in Astrobiology examines the likelihood of the planet Venus being able to support life within the thick cloud layer that envelopes it. This study holds the potential to help us better understand how life could exist under the intense Venusian conditions, as discussions within the scientific community about whether life exists on the second planet from the Sun continue to burn hotter than Venus itself. “There is a lot of interest in Venus at the moment, following Jane Greaves’ initial report of phosphine in the clouds,” Dr. William Bains, who is a Senior Research Fellow at Cardiff University and lead author of the study, tells Universe Today. “But opinions vary widely on whether there could be life there, from calling the clouds ‘habitable’ to saying definitively that there cannot be life there. So, we wanted to review what we know about Venus, and about the basic principles of life, and see whether life on Venus was a subject worth pursuing, or whether it could be ruled out from first principles.” Video explaining the initial report on phosphine in the clouds of Venus from Dr. Jane Greaves. For the study, the researchers discussed the various aspects of Venus’ clouds that could be responsible for potentially harboring any kind of life, even if it’s not Earth-like life. These include energy requirements for life, available chemical energy, lack of available hydrogen, lack of metals, cloud acidity, low water activity within the clouds, high radiation environment, and the mass of the Venus cloud biosphere. “Our conclusions were that conditions in the clouds do not rule out life, although they do rule out Earth-like life,” Dr. Bains tells Universe Today. “This is an important distinction – that not all life in the Universe needs be like Earth life.” The study also discussed future astrobiology-based space missions to Venus, specifically that they should be both small and cost-effective with the goal of answering science questions that are more focused in nature. The researchers note that while these smaller scale missions won’t answer all of the questions pertaining to Venus’ clouds, they will serve to “complement and inform larger missions” to Venus. “Life on the surface seems *extremely* unlikely,”\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://grow.cals.wisc.edu/departments/front-list/six-reasons-why-life-might-exist-on-venus\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Six Reasons Why Life Might Exist on Venus – Grow Front List Six Reasons Why Life Might Exist on Venus The ingredients for life are adrift in the Venusian clouds. Life is primarily composed of six chemical elements: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur. These elements are found in a variety of biological molecules, including DNA and RNA. Probes, landers, and balloons have found signatures of these elements in the planet’s clouds, and they may be usable by life-forms. Some terrestrial organisms, known as extremophiles, can survive in conditions akin to the Venusian clouds. The surface of Venus is hellish, with temperatures as high as 890 °F (unlivable for all known terrestrial organisms) and crushing pressures reaching about 93 standard atmospheres (atm), equivalent to the pressure experienced at 3,000 feet below sea level on Earth. The clouds, however, are more hospitable, with temperatures ranging from 212 to -49 °F and pressures between 1.18 and 0.0336 atm. Here on Earth, microbial cells have been found dormant (not metabolically active but still alive) at temperatures as low as -49 °F. On the other end of the spectrum, some terrestrial archaea (single-cell organisms without nuclei) have been found to survive in temperatures as high as 251.6 °F In the ancient past, Venus may have been home to an ocean. Today, the clouds of Venus hold very little water vapor. However, climate models show that the planet’s surface likely boasted a shallow liquid water ocean for about 2 or 3 billion years after it formed and cooled. Any liquid water that may have existed is gone now, but its presence — a requirement for all known forms of life — means that life could have arisen on early Venus. A vast number of microorganisms are still waiting to be discovered.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d5\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2282212-the-clouds-of-venus-are-too-dry-to-support-life-as-we-know-it/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"The clouds of Venus are too dry to support life as we know it | New ... The clouds of Venus are too dry to support life as we know it There’s not enough water in Venus’s clouds to support life as we know it Alamy Stock Photo The clouds of Venus, which are mostly made of sulphuric acid, have far less water and far more acid than even the most extreme lifeforms on Earth would be able to survive. This is according to a new analysis of the habitability of the planet’s atmosphere. This finding puts a damper on recent signs of potential life there. In 2020, a team led by Jane Greaves at Cardiff University in the UK found evidence of a compound called phosphine in Venus’s toxic clouds. On Earth, phosphine is a byproduct of life, and the team couldn’t come up with another way to produce it on Venus, so suggested that it could hint at life there. However, a new study by John Hallsworth at Queen’s University Belfast, UK, and his colleagues based on a combination of laboratory experiments and observations from probes sent to Venus in the late 1970s and early 80s suggests that life might be impossible in those clouds. Advertisement They based that conclusion on calculations of water activity in the clouds’ droplets, a measure similar to humidity. Pure liquid water would have a water activity of 1, and perfect dryness would have a score of 0. They found a water activity of less than 0.004 for Venus’s clouds, partly because acid in a droplet lowers its water activity. This is a concentration of water 100 times below what is needed for the most resilient microorganisms on Earth, said Hallsworth in a press conference. “It’s an unbridgeable distance from what life requires to be active.” In an area that arid, the membranes that hold cells together would fall apart, he said. “Even the most dry-tolerant microbe on Earth wouldn’t stand a chance on Venus.” Of course, a microbe on Earth has no need to be hardy enough to survive Venus.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d6\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/news/2020/september/possible-signs-of-life-found-on-venus.html\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Possible signs of life found on Venus | Natural History Museum Researchers have been using telescopes to look for evidence of phosphine in Venus's clouds since 2016. Prof Sara Seager, a planetary scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a co-author on the new study, was careful to emphasise that this is not yet conclusive proof of life. She says, 'We are not claiming to have found life on Venus. We are claiming a confident detection of phosphine gas whose existence is a mystery.' Volcanoes can produce phosphine, but only miniscule amounts - far less than the quantities detected by the scientists. They also ruled out things like lightening and meteorites. Researchers are left with another possibility - that small organisms are responsible. Sara says, 'We hope our work will motivate space mission that go to Venus and directly measure gasses in the atmosphere. People have speculated about life in Venus's atmosphere for decades. 'Perhaps life originated in the past when Venus was cooler, with liquid water oceans. 'As Venus heated up the oceans evaporated and the surface became so hot that any life would have been killed, but any life in the clouds would have survived.' Earth has life in its clouds too, swept up from the surface. Bacteria live in the liquid water droplets, which are then rained back down on Earth. Earth's clouds don't last long before they turn to rain, but on Venus the clouds are permanent. However, Venus's atmosphere is very harsh so it is difficult to directly compare it to Earth. What is phosphine? Phosphine is a toxic, colourless, smelly gas with an odour often likened to rotting fish and garlic. On Earth, phosphine is produced by microbes, but we don't know for sure which organisms give it off. It is usually found in oxygen-free environments, where only certain types of bacteria survive.

They get inside droplets and the wind carries them across entire continents and oceans.” Seager explains that, over time, the water droplets housing microbes in Earth’s atmosphere condense, growing larger and heavier. And eventually, they fall down to the surface. But falling from Venus’ clouds would almost certainly be lethal to any microbes, as the planet’s blistering surface temperatures reach more than 860 degrees Fahrenheit (460 Celsius). “So, the question we posed was, ‘Well, how does it live permanently in the clouds?” says Seager. Venus is permanently shrouded in clouds. But the middle and lower cloud layers host temperatures and pressures that are surprisingly hospitable to life. But in Venus’ lower haze layer, the conditions take a turn for the worse. Seager et al. (2020) Co-author Janusz Petkowski, a research fellow at MIT, explains to Astronomy that the team’s hypothesis is that venusian life could exist in a metabolically active state — growing and reproducing — in sulfuric acid cloud droplets within the lower cloud layer. Over a period of a few months, the droplets themselves would grow in mass just like water droplets on Earth. Eventually, they would be large enough to ‘rain out’ of the lower clouds. And that means they would fall into Venus’s lower haze layer.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d8\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.cnet.com/science/features/venus-cant-sustain-life-in-the-clouds-but-jupiter-has-potential/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Venus can't sustain life in the clouds, but Jupiter has potential - CNET Venus can't sustain life in the clouds, but Jupiter has potential Venus clouds have captivated Earthlings for decades. They form a dazzling mirror that obscures the planet's surface and, in the 1950s, one Israeli scholar even speculated the clouds may hide a world teeming with insect life capable of enduring the extreme heat. When Russia's Venera spacecraft took images of the surface in 1975, there were no insects to be found. Venus is a desolate hellscape, the victim of a runaway greenhouse effect that has sent temperatures on the ground soaring to well over 850 degrees Fahrenheit -- hot enough to melt lead. But in the clouds, more temperate climes await any would-be alien lifeforms. Up in the atmosphere, life might just find a way. At least, that was one hypothesis. It can happen on Earth... so why not elsewhere? Last year, the idea that microbes might call the atmosphere of Venus home was bolstered by a study that claimed to have discovered elevated levels of phosphine -- an unstable gas associated with biological activity -- in the cloud deck of our sister planet. That spawned the theory that microbes in the clouds could be producing the gas. As scientists untangled the phosphine signal, though, the possibility that it was a sign of life in Venus' clouds looked less and less likely. On Monday, the likelihood of a drifting community of microbes in the clouds took another blow. \\\"The most extreme life on Earth would stand no chance whatsoever of living in the Venus clouds,\\\" John Hallsworth, a microbiologist at Queen's University Belfast and the lead author of the new paper, told me.

A radar image of Venus, based on data from NASA’s Magellan spacecraft. Credit: NASA and JPL Advertisement The amount of water in the atmosphere of Venus is so low that even the most drought-tolerant of Earth’s microbes wouldn’t be able to survive there, a new study has found. The findings seem to wipe out the hope stirred by last year’s discovery of molecules potentially created by living organisms in the scorched planet’s atmosphere that were seen as an indication of the possible presence of life. The new study looked at measurements from probes that flew through the atmosphere of Venus and acquired data about temperature, humidity and pressure in the thick sulphuric acid clouds surrounding the planet. From these values, the scientists were able to calculate the so-called water activity, the water vapor pressure inside the individual molecules in the clouds, which is one of the limiting factors for the existence of life on Earth. “When we looked at the effective concentration of water molecules in those clouds, we found that it was a hundred times too low for even the most resilient Earth organisms to survive.” John Hallsworth, a microbiologist at Queen’s University in Belfast, U.K., and lead author of the paper, said in a news conference on Thursday (June 24). “That’s an unbridgeable distance.” The findings are likely a disappointment for the Venus research community, which was invigorated last September by the discovery of phosphine, a compound made of atoms of phosphorus and hydrogen that on Earth can be associated with living organisms, in Venus’ atmosphere. At that time, researchers suggested the phosphines may be produced by microorganisms residing in those clouds. On Earth, Hallsworth said, microorganisms can survive and proliferate in droplets of water in the atmosphere when temperatures allow. However, the findings of the new study, based on data from several Venus probes, leave zero chance of anything living in the clouds of Venus, he said. “Living systems including microorganisms are composed mainly of water and without being hydrated, they can’t be active and are unable to proliferate,”\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d12\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/venus-jupiter-life-clouds-1.6083076\",\n    \"snippet\": \"There's no life in the clouds of Venus, study says.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON. The rest is plain text.\n- ≥80% of final-answer sentences include [dX] (unless abstaining).\n- Use an EM DASH \" — \" in the label line (not hyphen or en dash).\n- Be precise and faithful; no new facts; respect length budgets.\n\nInputs:\n\n- query:\n{query}\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n{retrieved_docs}\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n{per_doc_notes}\n\nTask:\n1) Follow the full OUTPUT CONTRACT exactly.\n   • <think> block with:\n       (A) VALID JSON array for EVERY doc d1…dN (order-preserving, one object per doc; if verdict==\"irrelevant\" set key_fact=\"\")\n       (B) Conflict reasoning FIRST: cluster docs, reference doc IDs, and NAME the mechanism (temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive)\n       (C) ONE label line: \"<ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\"\n       (D) Brief reasoning connecting evidence to the final answer (or abstention)\n   • ONE blank line\n   • Final answer (or exactly \"CANNOT ANSWER, INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\" if abstaining)\n   • Final sentinel line [[END-OF-ANSWER]].\n\nReminders (DO NOT PRINT):\n- Reason FIRST for the conflict: write the analysis in (B), THEN emit the label line in (C); the label must be a direct consequence of the reasoning.\n- Conflict taxonomy (strict): No conflict / Complementary information / Conflicting opinions or research outcomes / Conflict due to outdated information / Conflict due to misinformation.\n- Use only existing doc_ids in bracketed citations [dX]; no ranges like d1–d5; never cite out-of-bounds [dK].\n- Prefer high-credibility sources and order citations high→low in the evidence list.\n- If any doc is \"supports\" or \"partially supports\", DO NOT abstain.\n- Close </think> before the answer; no extra text outside the required format."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Inputs:\n\n- query:\nwho was the first elected president of pakistan?\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_Pakistan\",\n    \"snippet\": \"List of presidents of Pakistan - Wikipedia There have been a total of 13 presidents.

On 5th March 1956, Major General Iskander Mirza became the first elected President of Pakistan. The 1956 constitution provides for Parliamentary form of government with all the executive powers in the hands of Prime Minister. President was Head of the State and was to be elected by all Members of the National and Provincial Assemblies. He was to hold office for 5 years. The President was to act on the advice of Prime Minister, except where he was empowered to act in his discretion. Under 1956 Constitution, Parliament was unicameral. Legislative powers vested in the Parliament, which consisted of the President and the National Assembly comprising 300 Members divided equally between East and West Pakistan. In addition to these 300 seats, five seats were reserved for women for each of the two wings, for a period of ten years: thus bringing the total membership of the House to 310. However, in the absence of any law to control the Political Parties and the problem of floor crossing, political instability perpetually ensued. Although the first general election were scheduled for early 1959, President Sikandar Mirza abrogated the Constitution, dissolved the National and Provincial Assemblies, and declared Martial Law, on 7th October 1958. He appointed General Muhammad Ayub Khan, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, as the Chief Martial Law Administrator. On 27th October 1958 General Muhammad Ayub Khan took-over as a second President of Pakistan. One of the first major steps taken by General Ayub Khan was the appointment of a Constitution Commission on 17th February 1960. The objective of this commission was to submit proposals, as to how best democracy can be strengthened and molded according to the country’s socio-political environment and Islamic principles of justice. The Commission submitted its report to the government on 29th April 1961. On the basis of this report a new Constitution was framed and given to the nation on 1st March 1962.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d6\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.local.com.pk/government/offices/president/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"President of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari became 14th President of Pakistan on 10 March 2024.

Editorial credit: Mirko Kuzmanovic / Shutterstock.com. Pakistan has a federal parliamentary republic government where the President is the ceremonial figurehead. The President is also the Pakistani Head of State and Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief, and elected by an Electoral College. The Electoral College is made up of the National Assembly, the Senate, and the regional assemblies of the constituent provinces of Pakistan. Members of the provincial assembly and the national assembly are elected by the citizens through multiparty elections, whereas the members of the Senate are indirectly elected by the provincial assemblies. Pakistan gained its independence in 1947, and the post of the Presidency was introduced in 1956. The first President of Pakistan was Iskander Mirza. Here are some notable Presidents in Pakistan's past. Iskander Mirza Iskander Mirza was born in 1899, and as a young man he enrolled at the Elphinstone College in Bombay before later moving to England to continue his higher studies at the Royal Military Academy in Sandhurst. In 1919 he went back to India and was conscripted into the British Indian Army. Iskander Mirza begun his career in the Army and later joined the Indian Public Service in 1926. In early 1930, he became the District Officer and from 1938- 1945 he became a Political Agent of North West Frontier Province. Mirza was appointed to the position of the Joint Defence Secretary and was supposed to split the British Indian Army to form the India and Pakistan groups in 1946. He served as the Defense Secretary and later as Governor of East Pakistan. Iskander Mirza served as Governor General in 1955. In 1956 under the new constitution, the position of the President was created, and Iskander became the first President of Pakistan. However, he was forced to leave office and exiled to London in 1958, where he lived for the remaining part of his life.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d9\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.britannica.com/topic/list-of-prime-ministers-of-Pakistan-2230533\",\n    \"snippet\": \"List of prime ministers of Pakistan | Dates, History, Tenure, & From ... Below is a list of prime ministers of Pakistan since its independence. A name in italics indicates a caretaker prime minister. The office of prime minister was inaugurated alongside Pakistan’s independence in 1947. It was abolished for several years under the country’s second constitution, which instituted a presidential system of government. The office was restored in December 1971, at the tail end of the war between West Pakistan and East Pakistan (now Pakistan and Bangladesh, respectively), but it was abrogated later that month. It was reintroduced in 1973 with the promulgation of the country’s third constitution. No prime minister of Pakistan has ever completed a full term in office. Most prime ministers have been dismissed or disqualified from holding office. Several others have resigned. The first prime minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, was assassinated. The remaining prime ministers were designated to carry out a partial term after the office became vacant. Below is a list of prime ministers of Pakistan since its independence.

As the political standoff continued, Sharif and Ishaq Khan resigned their respective offices in July. 2 Shehbaz Sharif advised Pres.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array;

The Golden Bear won six green jackets during his career. Editions Masters winners by player: Who has won the most green jackets in golf history? Jacob Camenker • • One of the reasons the Masters is a celebrated major tournament is because of the green jacket. It's a symbol of golf royalty, and it's one that only a select few have earned over the years. The Masters tournament has been played 87 times since it began in 1934. Only 56 players have won green jackets during that time. That's because several of history's best golfers have won the tournament on multiple occasions. But who has tamed the ever-tough Augusta National Golf Club the most? That honor belongs to one of the sport's legends, who won a green jacket half a dozen times during his legendary career. Who has the most Masters wins? Jack Nicklaus has won the Masters more than any other golfer. The Golden Bear won six green jackets during his career. The six wins came over 23 years, with the first coming in 1963 and the last in 1986. Is anyone close to catching Nicklaus? Yes, actually. Tiger Woods has the second-most Masters wins of all time. He moved within one of Nicklaus via his win at the 2019 tournament and has five to his name. Woods, 48, has now surpassed the age at which Nicklaus won his final Masters. As such, it may prove difficult for him to match Nicklaus' six titles, especially as Woods continues to deal with lingering injury issues from a February 2021 car crash that nearly resulted in his right leg being amputated. But as long as Woods is still participating in the event, never say never.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-04-14\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.bleachernation.com/news/2024/04/14/masters-green-jackets/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"List of Masters Winners by Year: Who Has Won The Most Green ...

The Masters is as prestigious in its nature as it is difficult to win. The green jacket that one is awarded for winning the tournament is perhaps one of the most recognizable sporting symbols, but which golfers have written their names into the pages of golfing royalty, and how many times? Let’s look at the full list of those who have won it more than once, which world number one Scottie Scheffler hopes to join after his triumph at Augusta National in 2022. Who has won the Masters more than once? Initiated in 1934, the Masters has been played on 85 occasions since its inception. At that time, there were only 54 winners of the legendary green jacket. Why is that, you ask? Simply because a number of golfers have managed to win the tournament on multiple occasions. The question, of course, is who they have been and just how many times they won at the notoriously difficult Augusta National Golf Club. Moreover, who among those champions has won the most? Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods: the cream of the crop When it comes taming the notoriously difficult course at the Augusta National Golf Club, one golfer stands above the rest: the ‘Golden Bear’ himself, Jack Nicklaus. Across a 23-year span, Nicklaus took home the green jacket on six different occasions. The first of those was in 1963, and the last in 1986. If you’re wondering, Yes, Tiger Woods is next in line. Woods currently has five Masters titles to his name - the most recent coming in 2019 - and at 48, is only two years older than Nicklaus was when he won his final Masters tournament. However, Woods has committed to taking part this year and will likely leave his participation up in the air until the last moment, depending on his physical condition; he suffered open fractures to both his tibia and fibula, as well as severe ankle damage, in a horrific car crash in 2021. We’ll have to wait and see if he pitches up at Augusta this next week.

From the moment the legendary Bobby Jones found the gorgeous parcel of land, hired legendary course designer Alister MacKenzie and established the first \\\"Augusta National Invitation Tournament,\\\" what later became known as The Masters has been the site of some of golf's most memorable moments. Here's a look at some of the many golfers who have made The Masters so special: Who has won most Masters titles? Jack Nicklaus leads the way with six Masters victories. He won his first Green Jacket in 1963. Nicklaus won back-to-back titles in 1965 and 1966, prevailed again in 1972 and 1975, then pulled off one of golf's greatest final-round comebacks in 1986. Tiger Woods is second with five Masters titles. Woods burst onto the scene as a 21-year-old in 1997, winning that year by a record 12 strokes. He also claimed consecutive titles in 2001 and 2002, added another in 2005, and authored a career comeback of his own by winning for the fifth time in 2019.

Masters 2024: Tiger Woods eyes Jack Nicklaus' six Green Jackets record at Augusta National - BBC Sport. Tiger Woods insisted he can still tie Jack Nicklaus' record of six Masters wins after making a record 24th consecutive cut at Augusta National. The 15-time major champion is seven shots off the lead at the halfway stage after a level-par 72 left him one over. The 48-year-old's fellow Americans Scottie Scheffler, Max Homa and Bryson DeChambeau lead on six under par. \\\"It means I have a chance to win the golf tournament. Anyone who makes the weekend has a chance,\\\" said Woods. \\\"I'm right there. \\\" Woods came from six shots back at the halfway stage to win his fourth Green Jacket in 2005 but that was before he suffered a catalogue of injures that mean his body \\\"aches every day\\\" - although the then 43-year-old shocked many by winning a fifth title in 2019. He has undergone more operations since then, chiefly to repair leg and ankle injuries suffered in a 2021 car crash that left Woods questioning whether he would play professional golf again. And that aching body was evident on Friday when he had to play 23 holes - five to complete his first round after storms shortened Thursday's opening day, then 18 in the second round. But he battled blustery conditions to keep himself in the hunt for a 16th major and was afforded a standing ovation by the spectators gathered around the 18th green when he finished. He then smiled as he said he would be contacting Fred Couples to \\\"give him a bit of needle\\\" about moving clear of the 1992 Masters winner and three-time champion Gary Player, who both made 23 consecutive Masters cuts. Woods is joint 22nd and will know history is against him, with just one one of the past 28 Masters champions being outside the top 10 at this stage - South Africa's Charl Schwartzel, who was also six back when he went on to win in 2011.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-04-13\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d10\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/texas-sports-nation/general/article/scottie-scheffler-masters-texas-college-most-19403338.php\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Which college has produced most Masters golf winners?

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Role of genetics, risk factors, and prevention Is leukemia hereditary? Leukemia does not tend to run in families and therefore is not usually hereditary. Some people inherit genetic features that increase their risk, but this does not mean they will develop the condition. Scientists know that genetic changes play a role in the development of leukemia, but not all genetic features are hereditary. Sometimes, a person is born with a genetic feature they have not inherited from their biological parents. This feature developed after conception but before birth. Such features may increase the risk of leukemia. Environmental and lifestyle factors can also affect someone’s genes and increase their risk. These factors include exposure to toxic chemicals and smoking. These types of genetic changes occur during a person’s lifetime, and doctors call them acquired genetic changes. While scientists have identified both acquired and inherited genetic features that occur with leukemia, they have not identified any hereditary gene that causes the disease. In most cases, it is not possible to know why leukemia occurs. This article will explore the links between leukemia, family history, and genetics. We also discuss the risk factors and tips for preventing this condition. However, leukemia-related DNA changes usually develop after conception rather than being inherited from a parent’s genes. Exposure to radiation, chemicals, infections, and other environmental factors contribute to genetic changes that result in atypical DNA. Genetic features Leukemia is a genetic disease that results from changes in a person’s genes. People can inherit genetic risk factors, or their genes can change because of environmental triggers. The authors of a 2019 study found that certain gene mutations, specifically FLT3-ITD and NRAS mutations, frequently appear in people with AML-M5, a type of AML that forms in immature white blood cells. Family history Inherited forms of leukemia appear to be rare. However, some subtypes of the following leukemias may be due to inherited genetic features: AML CLL MDS There may be another inherited condition in the family with the same genetic change, such as a platelet deficiency or immune condition.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/leukemia-acute-myeloid-aml/risk-factors\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Leukemia - Acute Myeloid - AML: Risk Factors | Cancer.Net Leukemia - Acute Myeloid - AML: Risk Factors ON THIS PAGE: You will find out more about the factors that increase the chance of developing acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Use the menu to see other pages. A risk factor is anything that increases a person’s chance of developing cancer. Although risk factors often influence the development of cancer, most do not directly cause cancer. Some people with several risk factors never develop cancer, while others with no known risk factors do. Knowing your risk factors and talking about them with your doctor may help you make more informed lifestyle and health care choices. Although the cause of AML is not known, several factors are associated with an increased risk of the disease. The following factors may raise a person’s risk of developing AML: Age. AML is more common in older adults, but it occurs at all ages. About half of people with AML are older than 65 when diagnosed. Smoking. The risk of AML has been linked to exposure to tobacco smoke, probably along with other causes. Genetic disorders. Increasingly, researchers are finding that leukemia may run in a family due to inherited gene mutations. AML occurs more often in people with the following inherited disorders: Germline mutations which are present at birth, the most common of which are changes to the GATA2, ETV6, CEBPA, and RUNX1 genes High doses of radiation. People who have been exposed to high levels of radiation may be more likely to develop AML. This includes people who have received radiation treatment for another cancer or long-term survivors of atomic bombs. Electromagnetic fields generated by high-voltage electrical power lines have not been shown to cause AML. Cell phone use is not a known risk factor for AML. Chemotherapy. People who have received chemotherapy for another cancer may develop a therapy-related AML. Chemicals. Long-term contact with products containing the chemical benzene, found in petroleum, cigarette smoke, and industrial workplaces, raises the risk of AML. However, exposure to industrial solvents and hair dyes has not been proven to increase a person’s risk of AML.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.healthline.com/health/leukemia-hereditary\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Leukemia and Your Risk Factors: Is It Hereditary? Leukemia and Your Risk Factors: Is It Hereditary? Leukemia is a cancer of the body’s bone marrow, which is where your blood cells are made. It’s a genetic disease, but most cases aren’t thought to be hereditary. Instead, a variety of risk factors can make you more likely to get the disease. Some of these risk factors are in your control, others aren’t. Scientists think the various types of leukemia are caused by mutations in the DNA of your blood cells. These genetic mutations change the way the blood cells in your bone marrow reproduce. They can also prevent these blood cells from functioning properly. Eventually, the abnormal blood cells crowd out your healthy blood cells. They can block your bone marrow from producing more healthy cells. The mutations are genetic, but usually not hereditary. This means that while leukemia is caused by mutations in your genes, these genetic abnormalities aren’t often inherited from your family. This is called an acquired gene mutation. It’s not always known what causes these mutations. You may be genetically predisposed to developing leukemia, but lifestyle risk factors, such as cigarette smoking, can also make you more likely to develop leukemia. Other environmental factors, such as exposure to certain chemicals and radiation, could also be behind the DNA abnormalities that can cause leukemia. These two terms aren’t interchangeable, although they both refer to diseases that are caused by mutations in your genes. Let’s take a closer look. Genetic disease A genetic disease isn’t always one that is passed down through your family. A genetic disease is any medical condition caused by a DNA abnormality, whether it’s inherited or acquired. This DNA abnormality is caused by a mutation in one gene or multiple genes. The mutations can take place during your lifetime as errors occur in cell production. They can also be caused by environmental factors. These environmental factors include exposure to radiation or certain chemicals. Hereditary disease A hereditary disease is a type of genetic disease in which the gene mutations are inherited from your family.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-021-02749-2\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Implications of ACMG guidelines to identify high-risk acute ... Background According to the global cancer observatory 2018, Asia is the most leukemia burdened region in the world with an incidence of 48.7% and a mortality rate of 53.7% of overall cases reported worldwide [1]. In Pakistan, acute lymphoblastic leukeima (ALL) is a predominant childhood cancer with an incidence of 20.8% as reported by the Punjab cancer registry 2017 [2]. Remarkable progress has been observed in improving the survival rate of acute lymphoblastic leukemia due to the implementation of the risk-adapted therapy and a greater understanding of the biological heterogeneity of the disease [3]. However, the etiology of leukemia is still unknown, and the major cause reported for this cancer is the same as other cancers involving the interaction of environmental factors and genetic susceptibility [4,5,6,7]. Hereditary cancer susceptibility syndromes include the predisposition to leukemia, often at an early age, caused by inherited mutations or polymorphisms. The identification of the HCSS aids in cancer surveillance and screening, optimizing the therapeutic response and advising the patient for genetic counselling to reduce the risk of cancer. The outcome of these practices helps to decline the incidence and morbidity rate of inherited leukemia among children [8, 9]. It is estimated that 5–10% of leukemia cases are attributed to genetic susceptibility [10].

Abstract Our understanding of familial predisposition to lymphoma (collectively defined as non-Hodgkin lymphoma [NHL], Hodgkin lymphoma [HL], and chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL]) outside of rare hereditary syndromes has progressed rapidly during the last decade. First-degree relatives of NHL, HL, and CLL patients have an ∼1.7-fold, 3.1-fold, and 8.5-fold elevated risk of developing NHL, HL, and CLL, respectively. These familial risks are elevated for multiple lymphoma subtypes and do not appear to be confounded by nongenetic risk factors, suggesting at least some shared genetic etiology across the lymphoma subtypes. However, a family history of a specific subtype is most strongly associated with risk for that subtype, supporting subtype-specific genetic factors. Although candidate gene studies have had limited success in identifying susceptibility loci, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified 67 single nucleotide polymorphisms from 41 loci, predominately associated with specific subtypes. In general, these GWAS-discovered loci are common (minor allele frequency >5%), have small effect sizes (odds ratios, 0.60-2.0), and are of largely unknown function. The relatively low incidence of lymphoma, modest familial risk, and the lack of a screening test and associated intervention, all argue against active clinical surveillance for lymphoma in affected families at this time. Introduction Lymphomas, defined as non-Hodgkin (NHL), Hodgkin (HL), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma, are the most common hematologic malignancies in western countries, and combined there are an estimated 95 520 newly diagnosed cases each year in the United States.1\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d6\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.uclahealth.org/medical-services/cancer-services/cancer-genetics\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Cancer Genetics Testing & Counseling | UCLA Health Cancer Genetics Testing & Counseling Our genetics experts use sophisticated technology to evaluate your risk of cancer and other disease.

These inherited changes result in hereditary cancer syndromes, including: Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP): A condition that can lead to colon cancer. FAP is characterized by precancerous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract. Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOCS): The most common type of inherited breast cancer. Inherited genetic mutations to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes increase a woman’s risk for breast and ovarian cancers. The BRCA gene mutation can also increase cancer risk in men, potentially leading to prostate or pancreatic cancer, melanoma and other cancers. Hereditary leukemia and hematologic malignancies syndromes: Inherited genes that create an increased risk of leukemia and other blood diseases. Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS): A rare genetic mutation of the TP53 gene that increases the risk of many types of cancer. The risk relates to soft tissue sarcomas, breast cancer, brain tumors, leukemia and lung cancer. Lynch syndrome: A predisposition for early onset colorectal cancer and cancer caused by mutations in the MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2 genes.

If I have had symptoms am I more likely to experience others in the future? The problems that occur most frequently in patients with LGL leukemia are low blood counts or rheumatoid arthritis. Generally, symptoms that develop are related to these problems. If the neutrophil count is too low (neutropenia), then patients may suffer from repeated bacterial infections. If the red cell count is too low (anemia) then patients may experience fatigue or shortness of breath when they exert themselves. Patients with LGL and rheumatoid arthritis are subject to the arthritis symptoms that can include pain, stiffness, and swelling in multiple joints. So, someone is not destined to continue to have problems in the future if treatment is successful. Is LGL leukemia hereditary? No, LGL leukemia is not inherited. Although patients may have mutations present in their leukemic LGL cells, these are acquired mutations and not present in other cells of the body. While rare, development of T-LGL leukemia after solid organ or hematopoietic (blood) stem cell transplant can occur. Currently, we have no definite evidence to support that any environmental agent can cause LGL leukemia. We continue to investigate the theory that the initial event leading to development of LGL leukemia may be infection with a new type of virus. No, we don’t recommend BMT/SCT for most patients with LGL leukemia, because: Most patients will respond to the usual medications for LGL leukemia and therefore not need a stem cell transplant Stem cell transplants have a high chance of serious side effects, including death In instances where the standard medicines for LGL leukemia have been unsuccessful, your oncologist may discuss BMT/SCT with you.

Li and Fraumeni Jr. proposed for the first time in 1969 the theory of a hereditary cancer syndrome characterized by the early development of multiple tumors [57]. Particularly, about 50% of patients with LFS develop the first tumor by age of 30 [58, 59], and almost one-third (15–35%) of them will develop multiple primary cancers over their lifetimes [60, 61]. Breast cancer, sarcoma and brain, and adrenocortical carcinoma represent about 77–80% of LFS-associated tumors. Less frequent malignancies associated with LS include leukemia and lung, colorectal, skin, gastric, and ovarian cancer and these account for 15% of the tumors [62]. Nevertheless, these less frequent tumors are present in the general population; thus, their presence in LFS families could be because of chance. On the other hand, in the context of a germline TP53 mutation, these tumors occur at earlier than expected median age at diagnosis. Particularly, for ovarian cancer the median age is 39.5, compared with 64.3 years for sporadic cases [63]. The lack of comprehensive studies regarding the genetic pathways involved in LFS-associated ovarian tumorigenesis is principally due to the extreme rarity of this syndrome in the general population. 5.

Although risk factors often influence the development of cancer, most do not directly cause cancer. Some people with several risk factors never develop cancer, while others with no known risk factors do develop cancer. Knowing your risk factors and talking about them with your doctor may help you make more informed lifestyle and health care choices. The cause of CML is not known, though researchers now understand how the disease develops from genetic changes in the bone marrow cells. Environmental factors account for only a small number of CML diagnoses. Family history does not appear to play a role in the development of CML. The following factors may raise a person’s risk of developing CML: Age. The average age of people diagnosed with CML is around 64. CML is uncommon in children and teens. Radiation exposure. Many people who were long-term survivors of the 1945 atomic bombings in Japan were diagnosed with CML.

The cause of leukemia is not known, but we do know it is not contagious (“catching”). It is not thought to be hereditary (inherited from your parents). Some research suggests that things in the environment may play a role in developing this type of cancer. Leukemia is a cancer of the bone marrow. Bone marrow is the tissue found inside many of the bones of the body. Bone marrow is where blood is made. With leukemia there is an overgrowth of immature cells called blasts or \\\"leukemic cells\\\" in the bone marrow. When so many blasts are produced, the bone marrow spaces become crowded. This crowding prevents normal blood cells (red cells, white cells, and platelets) from being produced (Picture 1). Because of the disease process, fewer normal blood cells and more leukemic cells circulate in the blood. There are two main types of childhood leukemia: Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) – this type accounts for 80 percent of all leukemia in children. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) – this type accounts for 20 percent. Signs and Symptoms of Leukemia A decrease in normal blood cells causes the symptoms of leukemia. When the number of red blood cells is low, a child is anemic and may become pale, listless and easily tired. When the number of white cells is low, the child is more likely to get infections and may have a fever. When the number of platelets is low, there may be bleeding problems such as nosebleeds and increased bruising. The child may also have bone pain. Spleen and abdomen may be enlarged and are tender to the touch. Diagnosis The diagnosis of leukemia is made after a bone marrow aspirate and possibly a bone marrow biopsy. Bone marrow tissue is examined by a pathologist under a microscope. The results of this procedure will show the doctor what type of leukemia the child has.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d12\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/128/21/2497/35710/Discussing-and-managing-hematologic-germ-line\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Discussing and managing hematologic germ line variants | Blood ... Hereditary hematologic cancers are very likely underdiagnosed. Barriers unique to collecting family history in the setting of a new diagnosis of leukemia include the often acute nature of this blood cancer and the need for urgent treatment, perhaps compounded by the common perception that hereditary leukemia is rare and unlikely to be encountered.1 However, awareness that cancer can be related to inherited factors is now increasing significantly in the general population, and rather than adding to the burden on families, discussing family history may be a welcomed chance to address concerns and questions.4,5 Key information to gather when collecting family history includes any occurrence of cancer in first-, second-, and ideally third-degree relatives. Documentation in the medical record should include all cancers and should also include the type, age at diagnosis, and parental lineage.6 Inquiring about other hematologic diagnoses, such as cytopenia and congenital anomalies, can also be helpful because the presentation of many of these familial leukemia conditions remains quite variable.1 A simple conversation with the patient and/or parents during the initial clinic visit can be the first step in collecting a family history. Collecting information on the types of cancer and ages of onset can help flag those patients with a pattern of cancer in the family who warrant referral for genetic counseling (Table 1). Earlier age of onset is often a feature of hereditary cancer predisposition, but history of multiple cases of late-onset MDS and AML has been associated with underlying DDX41 germ line mutations.7,7-9 Therefore family history is needed to accurately assess the risk for a genetic condition.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Learn about how—and why—Ramadan is observed. What Is Ramadan? Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. It is considered a holy month that honors the time when Allah, via the angel Gabriel, revealed the first verses of the Qur’an, the holy book of Islam, to a caravan trader named Muhammad. When Is Ramadan? This year, Ramadan is expected to begin at sundown on Friday, February 28, and end at sundown on Sunday, March 30. The final evening of Ramadan consists of a celebration called Eid al-Fitr, when the traditional month-long fast is ended with a feast. Read Next The exact beginning and ending times of the month of Ramadan are based on the sighting of the first crescent Moon on the last night of the eighth month (Sha’ban). Specifically, Ramadan is said to begin at the first observance of the crescent Moon over Mecca, Saudi Arabia (or on a date predetermined by astronomical calculation). Because of this, start and end dates are not set in stone and may vary by a day. The dates listed below are based on expected visibility, so they may differ slightly from those seen elsewhere.

Ramadan begins the evening of March 10 Ramadan, the most sacred time of the year for Muslims, begins Sunday night, March 11, and ends on Thursday, April 11. This is a time of immense significance in the Islamic community. The month-long, lunar holiday serves as a sacred period of introspection, spiritual growth and self-discipline for Muslims worldwide. Ramadan is a time marked by fasting from dawn to sunset, when Muslims abstain not only from food and drink, but from daily pleasures as well. Fasting during Ramadan serves as a powerful reminder of empathy and compassion for those less fortunate. By experiencing hunger and thirst, individuals gain a heightened understanding of the struggles faced by those who live in poverty. This shared experience fosters a sense of solidarity and motivates believers to engage in acts of charity, kindness and community service. It becomes a time for selflessness, reinforcing the importance of generosity and helping those in need. During this Ramadan season, I ask the campus community to be flexible with students recognizing the holiday as they may be absent from class during prayer time and may request extra accommodations to complete their assigned work. Stay tuned to Marquette Today and the Campus Ministry Instagram for more information on an upcoming Iftar dinner hosted by Campus Ministry. Ramadan serves as a transformative period, encouraging individuals to transcend their worldly desires and cultivate qualities of patience, gratitude and humility. Through self-control, believers aim to purify their hearts and souls, striving for a higher level of consciousness and spiritual enlightenment. Ramadan, therefore, stands as a beacon of self-discipline and personal growth, guiding individuals to a more virtuous and fulfilling life.

Ramadan at MSU A Brief Guide for 2021 Beginning in mid-April, many MSU students and employees will begin the month-long fast of Ramadan. As we work toward promoting a more inclusive Spartan community, here are some facts to consider: Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar and is widely considered the month in which the Qur’an (Koran), the Islamic holy book, was first revealed. This year, Ramadan will begin at sunset on April 12, give or take a day (depending on when the new moon is sighted), and will last 29 or 30 days. As the Islamic year is approximately 11 days shorter than the Gregorian year, Ramadan in 2022 will begin around April 1. Fasting in the month of Ramadan is one of the “five pillars” of Islam. The Qur’an (2:183) states that fasting was prescribed so that believers may attain God-consciousness. Accordingly, Ramadan is widely regarded as a month of spiritual growth. Practicing Muslims who are able to do so are expected to abstain from eating, drinking (including water) and sexual relations from dawn to sunset each day of the month. Many Muslims will also perform various prayers and acts of devotion, especially at night, sometimes past midnight. And as many adherents also wake up early for predawn meals, they may experience not just hunger and thirst but also fatigue. Those who are ill, traveling, or unable to fast for other reasons are exempt from the Ramadan fast. Those who are able to do so are expected to make up the missed days at a later time. The end of Ramadan is marked by the Islamic holiday Eid al-Fitr (“the festival of the breaking of the fast”), which will begin this year at sunset on May 12, give or take a day. Eid al-Fitr is one of the two major Islamic holidays, the other being Eid al-Adha (“the festival of sacrifice”), which overlaps with the annual Hajj (\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2021-01-01\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d7\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://islamic-relief.org/ramadan-2025-key-dates-common-questions-our-work/ramadan-timetable-2025-islamic-relief-worldwide/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Ramadan Timetable 2025 - Islamic Relief Worldwide This year, the holy month of Ramadan is expected to begin on Friday, Feb. 28, or Saturday, March 1, 2025.

Ramadan begins on Sunday 10 March 2024 and is expected to conclude on Tuesday 9 April 2024, meaning Eid al-Fitr is likely to fall on Wednesday 10 April 2024. The tablets of Ibrahim, the Torah, the Psalms, the Gospel, and the Quran were sent down on the 1st, 6th, 12th, 13th and 24th days of Ramadan, according to the faith. When is Ramadan? Ramadan begins on Sunday 10 March 2024 and is expected to conclude on Tuesday 9 April 2024, meaning Eid al-Fitr is likely to fall on Wednesday 10 April 2024. Why does the date vary each year? The Islamic calendar is lunar, meaning each month begins with a new astronomical moon. As lunar months are shorter than solar, the Islamic calendar does not correspond with the Gregorian calendar followed in the West, so that means Ramadan occurs around 10 days earlier every year. The period takes place in the ninth month of the Islamic year. Its precise date also varies from country to country by about a day, depending on when the moon is sighted. Followers of the faith are encouraged to check the precise timings of sunrise and sunset with their local mosques to ensure the fast is not inadvertently broken prematurely. Why do Muslims fast? ​Ramadan is a holy month dedicated to prayer and reading the Quran. Generosity and giving to worthy causes and neighbours are encouraged. It is a period for reflection, self-restraint, and warmth intended to bring Muslims closer to Allah, hence the abstention from earthly distractions like food and water, cigarettes, and sexual activity during daylight hours. A modest meal is taken before dawn known as “suhoor” and after dusk known as “iftar” but nothing whatsoever is consumed in between, not even water. Fasting during Ramadan is a requirement for all Muslims from a young age, in some cases beginning as early as 10. Those who are too ill to fast can be exempted if participating would mean endangering their health, as can the elderly, those suffering from a mental illness,\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-04-06\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d9\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.brandeis.edu/spiritual-life/resources/guide-to-observances/ramadan.html\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Ramadan | A Guide to Religious Observances - Brandeis University Ramadan will be approximately March 10 - April 9 in 2024. Fasting times in 2024 are between 5:46 a.m. and 6:48 p.m. at the beginning of Ramadan and 4:52 a.m.- 7 ... This prayer is called Tarawih. What and When is Ramadan? The holy month of Ramadan is the 9th month in the Islamic lunar calendar. It is a month of fasting, worship, service, communal gathering, and spiritual development. Fasting in Ramadan is one of the Five Pillars of Islam. Since there are 12 lunar months superimposed over 12 solar months, Ramadan “moves back” about 11 days per solar year. In 2024, the first day of fasting is expected to be March 11, though given differing interpretive schools among Muslim communities, some may declare the month to begin a day before or after the predicted date. Likewise, the holiday commemorating the end of fasting, most often called Eid al-Fitr in the US, may fall on different days according to varying family, cultural, or interpretive preferences. The Eid holiday that marks the end of fasting is expected around April 9 (dates may vary). It consists of a congregational prayer in the morning followed by visiting family and friends. The full day of Eid is a holiday, not just the morning prayers, and many will choose to take the day off. As such, it is an excused absence per the Academic Coursework and Religious Observance Policy. Others may prefer to return to school or work and take exams on Eid. In some cultures, the two days after Eid are also counted as part of the holiday. Key takeaways: Fasting is defined as no food, drink, or sexual relations from before the first light of dawn until the setting of the sun. Ramadan will be approximately March 10 - April 9 in 2024. Fasting times in 2024 are between 5:46 a.m. and 6:48 p.m. at the beginning of Ramadan and 4:52 a.m.- 7:21p.m. by the end of Ramadan. Some may start fasting earlier and break fast later.

Each person engages their religious life and the challenges ... Resources for the Month of Ramadan The month of Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar and commemorates the first revelation of God to the Prophet Mohammad for the Muslim community. The fasting of the month of Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Muslim faith, and observant Muslims will not eat or drink from sunrise to sunset during the month, which is from the sighting of one crescent moon to the next. This is a season of reflection, contemplation, and empathy; the act of fasting during the month of Ramadan is to redirect one’s attention from earthly self-centered things to an awareness and commitment to higher ideals and purposes. The holy month also includes additional attention to one’s prayer life and the recitation of the Qur'an. The gathering for fast breaking each night during the month of Ramadan, iftars, is a significant moment of community connection and joy. Traditionally dates are eaten at the breaking of the fast each night before prayers, commemorating the Prophet Mohammad’s practice of breaking the fast by eating three dates. The struggle of the fast, therefore, is complimented by the celebration of sharing a meal with others. For most Muslims, the month of Ramadan begins this year on Sunday, March 10 and ends on April 9. Each person engages their religious life and the challenges of fasting differently. The Office of the University Chaplain with Kay Spiritual Life Center has helped coordinate the following resources for prayer and fast-breaking: Extended Building Hours The Kay Spiritual Life Center building will be open extended hours during the month of Ramadan to provide access prior to the sunrise and after sunset. Extended hours: 5am- 11pm. The Muslim Prayer Room is located in the lower level of Kay Spiritual Life Center. Break-fast Basket Throughout the month of Ramadan, there will be a rotating assortment of snacks, dates, and beverages for the Muslim community to enjoy at the conclusion of the fasting period available in KSLC.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON. The rest is plain text.\n- ≥80% of final-answer sentences include [dX] (unless abstaining).\n- Use an EM DASH \" — \" in the label line (not hyphen or en dash).\n- Be precise and faithful; no new facts; respect length budgets.\n\nInputs:\n\n- query:\n{query}\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n{retrieved_docs}\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n{per_doc_notes}\n\nTask:\n1) Follow the full OUTPUT CONTRACT exactly.\n   • <think> block with:\n       (A) VALID JSON array for EVERY doc d1…dN (order-preserving, one object per doc; if verdict==\"irrelevant\" set key_fact=\"\")\n       (B) Conflict reasoning FIRST: cluster docs, reference doc IDs, and NAME the mechanism (temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive)\n       (C) ONE label line: \"<ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\"\n       (D) Brief reasoning connecting evidence to the final answer (or abstention)\n   • ONE blank line\n   • Final answer (or exactly \"CANNOT ANSWER, INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\" if abstaining)\n   • Final sentinel line [[END-OF-ANSWER]].\n\nReminders (DO NOT PRINT):\n- Reason FIRST for the conflict: write the analysis in (B), THEN emit the label line in (C); the label must be a direct consequence of the reasoning.\n- Conflict taxonomy (strict): No conflict / Complementary information / Conflicting opinions or research outcomes / Conflict due to outdated information / Conflict due to misinformation.\n- Use only existing doc_ids in bracketed citations [dX]; no ranges like d1–d5; never cite out-of-bounds [dK].\n- Prefer high-credibility sources and order citations high→low in the evidence list.\n- If any doc is \"supports\" or \"partially supports\", DO NOT abstain.\n- Close </think> before the answer; no extra text outside the required format."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Inputs:\n\n- query:\nwho is the owner of phoenix mall\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Street_Phoenix\",\n    \"snippet\": \"High Street Phoenix - Wikipedia High Street Phoenix, formerly known as Phoenix Mall, is one of the largest ...

South Asia's largest 20 lane bowling concourse was first started here in the year 1996. India's first Hyper market concept Big Bazaar was introduced in 2001 at High Street Phoenix. In 1938, the British government ordered firing at workers who were peacefully protesting the proposed Bombay Trades Disputes Bill.[8] The workers at Phoenix Mills went on a strike between 11 April 1939 and 1 November 1939, demanding an increase in pay.[9] Phoenix was affected by the general strike that shut down all mills in Mumbai (then Bombay) for over a year in 1982–83.[10] Mumbai's mills went through a turbulent time in the 1980s and '90s owing to labour unrest in addition to higher operating costs of a mill inside Mumbai, making mills such as Phoenix loss-making and nonviable entities.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Marketcity_(Bengaluru)\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Phoenix Marketcity (Bengaluru) - Wikipedia Phoenix Marketcity is a shopping mall developed by The Phoenix Mills Co.

Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON. The rest is plain text.\n- ≥80% of final-answer sentences include [dX] (unless abstaining).\n- Use an EM DASH \" — \" in the label line (not hyphen or en dash).\n- Be precise and faithful; no new facts; respect length budgets.\n\nInputs:\n\n- query:\n{query}\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n{retrieved_docs}\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n{per_doc_notes}\n\nTask:\n1) Follow the full OUTPUT CONTRACT exactly.\n   • <think> block with:\n       (A) VALID JSON array for EVERY doc d1…dN (order-preserving, one object per doc; if verdict==\"irrelevant\" set key_fact=\"\")\n       (B) Conflict reasoning FIRST: cluster docs, reference doc IDs, and NAME the mechanism (temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive)\n       (C) ONE label line: \"<ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\"\n       (D) Brief reasoning connecting evidence to the final answer (or abstention)\n   • ONE blank line\n   • Final answer (or exactly \"CANNOT ANSWER, INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\" if abstaining)\n   • Final sentinel line [[END-OF-ANSWER]].\n\nReminders (DO NOT PRINT):\n- Reason FIRST for the conflict: write the analysis in (B), THEN emit the label line in (C); the label must be a direct consequence of the reasoning.\n- Conflict taxonomy (strict): No conflict / Complementary information / Conflicting opinions or research outcomes / Conflict due to outdated information / Conflict due to misinformation.\n- Use only existing doc_ids in bracketed citations [dX]; no ranges like d1–d5; never cite out-of-bounds [dK].\n- Prefer high-credibility sources and order citations high→low in the evidence list.\n- If any doc is \"supports\" or \"partially supports\", DO NOT abstain.\n- Close </think> before the answer; no extra text outside the required format."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Inputs:\n\n- query:\nwho sings gone gone gone she been gone so long?\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMf4NapohUQ\",\n    \"snippet\": \"My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone) (1981) - Chilliwack - YouTube Chilliwack - My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone) (1981) · Comments11.

Co-written by bandmembers Brian MacLeod and Bill Henderson. Background Guitarist Brian MacLeod invited singer Bill Henderson onto his boat to sail around the coast of British Columbia, fish, and write songs. MacLeod was playing some chord changes on a Fender Rhodes keyboard and singing the melody \\\"down down down down down d-down\\\". He thought it was a bad idea, \\\"like the Beach Boys, but with a lot of weird chord changes going on. \\\"[3] Henderson saw potential, and decided the words were \\\"Gone gone gone she's been gone so long, she's been gone gone gone so long.\\\" From there, MacLeod came up with chords for verses and chorus, and Henderson came up with the melody and made up a story around a girl being gone so long. The song was written in a day, the demo was recorded on Henderson's 4-track cassette studio recorder, and he added the bridge and a cappella that night.[3] In the studio, the band was under contract with Mushroom Records. In the asset-selling confusion that followed the death of its owner, the label would not let Chilliwack record. Under a pseudonym, they snuck into the studio and recorded anyway, then shopped \\\"My Girl\\\" and other songs around. This got them a deal with Millennium Records in New York, breaking them into the mainstream after eleven years.[3] Brian MacLeod pressed his face so close to the microphone to sing the intro that he would saturate it with moisture, the microphone would cut out, and they would have to stop every five words or so to wait for it to dry.[4] Reception MacLeod and Henderson were nominated for the Juno Award for 1982 Composer of the Year,[5] as well as Single of the Year for \\\"My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone).\\\".[6] In January 2019, the song became certified Platinum (in excess of 100,000 copies sold) as a single in Canada.[7] Year-end charts In popular culture On the April 23, 1982 episode of the sketch comedy TV series SCTV during the skit \\\"Pre-Teen World Telethon,\\\"[15]\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-06-14\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsrmNWorkJg\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Chilliwack - My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone) - [STEREO] - YouTube Chilliwack - My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone) - [STEREO] · Comments254.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

At least 20 tornadoes roared through Iowa, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island at the end of the month. While most were small, there was an EF-3 in Whitman, Nebraska. Rhode Island saw its first tornado in June since 1950 on June 26. May 2024 NOAA/NCEI states that there were 570 tornadoes in May, which is a significant increase from the 1991-2020 average of 268.4 tornadoes and the highest count ever recorded in May. Twisters have been reported in almost half the states in the country, and there were only two days in the month without at least one tornado. Out of the six billion-dollar weather and climate disasters were confirmed in May, three of them included tornadoes. May 6-10 Multiple tornadoes spawned from violent storms across the U.S., resulting in multiple casualties and injuries. There were 1,400 severe weather reports and 165 tornadoes confirmed across several states from May 6 to May 10. NCEI said that: “This multi-day tornado outbreak produced at least 61 EF-0, 79 EF-1, 13 EF-2, three EF-3, one EF-4 tornado and dozens of EF-U (unknown/unrated) tornadoes, causing widespread damage to many homes, businesses, vehicles, agriculture and other infrastructure.

This was below the 1991-2020 average of 54.1 tornadoes for the month. Ten of the 30 days in November had at least one reported tornado, and only three days had 5 or more tornadoes — November 2, 4, and 17. The majority of the month's tornadoes developed on November 4, which is the primary tornado event of the month and will be further detailed below. The 2024 year-to-date U.S. preliminary tornado count is 1,762, which is among the highest tornado counts on record for the same January-November period. Only 2011, 2008 and 2004 have a similar high count of tornadoes. The most damaging tornadoes of the month occurred late November 3 into November 4. Impacts in eastern Oklahoma, northeastern Texas, southern and eastern Missouri, and northwestern Arkansas were caused by a preliminary count of 18 tornadoes. The strongest and most damaging tornadoes impacted Oklahoma including a few that traversed the Oklahoma City metro region. Early on November 3 there was a brief EF-3 tornado that impacted Valley Brook, Oklahoma causing damage to vehicles, homes, businesses and ripping the roof from an elementary school, among other infrastructure damage. A second EF-3 tornado also caused damage near Harrah, Oklahoma. On November 4, there was also an EF-2 tornado that impacted Rogers, Arkansas causing damage to homes, vehicles, businesses and vegetation. The remaining tornadoes were EF-1 and EF-0 with impacts across Missouri, Arkansas and Texas.

Only 2004 ... The year started off somewhat slow with a below average number of tornadoes through the first three months. However, the El Niño pattern that was in place during that period weakened in April; the pattern shift caused the more traditional Tornado Alley zone to rapidly become extremely favorable for tornado outbreaks, and several large outbreaks occurred in late spring. In a month-long span between April 26 and May 26, almost 700 tornadoes touched down across the United States, causing widespread destruction and hundreds of casualties. Average to above average activity continued through essentially the rest of the year as several derechos and multiple outbreaks spawned by tropical cyclones occurred across the United States. As a result, 2024 ended as the second most active year on record for tornadoes, with 1,880 preliminary reports and at least 1,759 confirmed tornadoes. Only 2004 had more tornadoes with 1,817. This year surpassed 2019 as the busiest year ever recorded in Oklahoma, with at least 152 confirmed tornadoes.[1] 2024 was also the busiest year on record for tornadoes in Florida, Illinois, Iowa, New York, Ohio and West Virginia.[citation needed] Europe According to the European Severe Storms Laboratory, there have been 1,030 confirmed reports of tornadoes and waterspouts in Europe in 2024 (to date January 4, 2025), resulting in one fatality and 25+ injuries.[3] January January 3 (Belgium) A tornado struck the communities of Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-Waver and Putte in Belgium.

This page documents all tornadoes confirmed by various weather forecast offices of the National Weather Service in the United States from January to March 2024. Tornado counts are considered preliminary until final publication in the database of the National Centers for Environmental Information.[1] Based on the 1991–2020 average, about 39 tornadoes are typically recorded across the United States during January, about 36 tornadoes are recorded in February, and about 80 tornadoes are recorded in March.[2] These tornadoes are commonly focused across the Southern United States due to their proximity to the unstable air mass and warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, as well as California in association with winter storms in those three months.[3] With the arrival of spring, activity begins to shift northward especially later in March.[4] January saw near-average levels of tornado activity with 44 tornadoes, focused heavily on a single outbreak early in the month in the climatologically-favored Deep South. February had slightly above-average levels of tornado activity with 46 tornadoes. Many of those tornadoes occurred much further north than is typical for the month, in the Midwest and Great Lakes regions, including Wisconsin, which experienced tornadoes in February for the first time since modern record began in 1950. About half of the tornadoes during the month touched down during an outbreak at the end of the month. The amount of tornadic activity did not increase after the first two months of the year and March had well below-average activity with just 55 tornadoes. The bulk of the tornadoes that occurred in March came during a destructive outbreak in the middle of the month. Additionally, for the first time since 2018, no violent tornadoes occurred in the United States in March. A brief high-end EF0 tornado caused damage in Supreme. A poorly anchored and frail mobile home was tossed into a fire station building and a few other mobile homes had their roofs damaged.

Severe season Dr. Harold Brooks, Senior Research Scientist with NOAA/National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman Oklahoma, says this is the time of the year when the greatest number of tornadoes is observed. Historically, May has produced the most violent twisters.

This brings the number of documented tornadoes across West Virginia in 2024 to 20, setting a new record for the most tornadoes in a calendar year for the state. Here's a look at the tornadoes that have been documented: The first tornado to be documented since West Virginia became a state occurred in 1875 in Ritchie County. Since then 192 tornadoes have been documented across the state. The most active year up until 2024 was 1998 when 14 tornadoes occurred. Nine tornadoes were documented in 2014 and eight occurred in 2016. We are not alone in West Virginia as this has been an active year for tornadoes across the United States. Below are charts showing the preliminary tornado counts across the United States updated daily by the Storm Prediction Center. You may be wondering what is causing this increase in the number of tornadoes? This may be nothing abnormal at all! The numbers have increased in large part due to the fact that we are just finding more of the weaker EF0 and EF1 tornadoes. Due to the prevalence of security cameras, cell phones and social media, many more of these tornadoes are being recorded now than was possible in the past. Drones have also improved our ability to diagnose tornado damage vs. straight-line wind damage. It can be rather challenging sometimes figuring out whether damage was caused by a weak tornado or straight-line winds. This is especially true in hard to access areas or where there's not very many damage indicators. Before drones became commonplace, NWS survey teams were limited to what they could see from the road since aerial reconnaissance had to be done by costly fixed-wing planes or helicopters. Drones can now give us a complete picture of the damage, even in hard to access areas, and they have allowed us to be more accurate in what we call tornado vs. straight-line wind damage.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-09-30\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d9\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.3newsnow.com/weather/weather-blog/2024-is-the-second-most-active-tornado-year-on-record-so-far\",\n    \"snippet\": \"2024 is the second most active tornado year on record so far - KMTV With nearly 800 tornado reports across the United States from the beginning of the year to today, 2024 is the second most active tornado ...

If you have noticed this, there is a reason. Perhaps you might wonder how the Arbor Day Tornado Outbreak locally fits into the severe weather season. According to the Storm Prediction Center, 2024 has been the second-most active tornado year on record by tornado reports. So, how many tornadoes have there been? Will we continue to see an active tornado season? As of May 15, there have been 787 preliminary tornado reports sent to the Storm Prediction Center. There is an important distinction here between tornado reports and actual tornadoes. One tornado can have numerous reports, but it will be classified as a single tornado in the final count. As of writing this on May 15, 658 tornadoes have been confirmed in the United States. Here is the breakdown by their EF-rating: EF-U - 55 EF-0 (65-85 mph) - 200 EF-1 (86-110 mph) - 306 EF-2 (110-135 mph) - 75 EF-3 (136-165 mph) - 16 EF-4 (166-200 mph) - 2 EF-5 (200+ mph) - 0 SPC Preliminary tornado reports from the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma as of May 15. Before late April, the majority of the severe weather was focused on the Ohio River Valley and the southeast. The Florida panhandle saw the first tornado outbreak of the year on January 10. Wisconsin had its first February tornado on record in mid-February, and Chicago saw multiple tornadoes in late February. A tornado outbreak in mid-March brought numerous strong tornadoes to Indiana and Ohio. The April 26 Arbor Day Outbreak brought the traditional tornado alley roaring back to life when numerous strong tornadoes hit the Omaha area.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-05-15\"\n  }\n]\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"As of October 28, 2024, there have been 1,515 confirmed tornadoes in the United States that year.\",\n    \"quote\": \"As of Oct. 28, there have been 1,515 confirmed twisters this year, although many of the ratings are considered preliminary until published in the National\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The snippet explicitly states the number of confirmed tornadoes in the U.S. as of a specific date in 2024, directly answering the query.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"low\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"According to preliminary NOAA data, the 2024 year-to-date U.S. tornado count is 1,762.\",\n    \"quote\": \"The 2024 year-to-date U.S. preliminary tornado count is 1,762, which is among the highest tornado counts on record for the same January-November period.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"Explicitly provides the current year-to-date U.S. tornado count, directly answering the query.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"high\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"verdict\": \"partially supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"The National Centers for Environmental Information provides U.S. tornado statistics through November 2024 but does not state how many tornadoes occurred this year.\",\n    \"quote\": \"Tornado statistics for the Contiguous U.S. are provided by the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) and are available from November 1950—November 2024.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The snippet is relevant to U.S. tornado data but lacks the current year's confirmed tornado count.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"high\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"In 2024, there were at least 1,759 confirmed tornadoes in the United States.\",\n    \"quote\": \"2024 ended as the second most active year on record for tornadoes, with 1,880 preliminary reports and at least 1,759 confirmed tornadoes.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The snippet explicitly states the number of confirmed tornadoes in the United States for 2024, directly answering the query.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"high\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d5\",\n    \"verdict\": \"partially supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"From January to March 2024, the United States had 44 tornadoes in January, 46 in February, and 55 in March, totaling 145 confirmed tornadoes during that period.\",\n    \"quote\": \"January saw near-average levels of tornado activity with 44 tornadoes...

Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

While there might be temporary boosts to the economy in the short term from a tax cut due to increased incomes, changes in tax policy alter the incentives to work, save, and invest, which can produce benefits to economic growth in the long run. New research finds that while the benefits of personal income tax cuts are often concentrated in the short run, corporate income tax cuts generate “large and persistent” positive effects on the economy in the long run. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 permanently cut the statutory corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. However, most of The CJA’s individual and business provisions are set to expire after 2025. For example, full expensing for short-lived equipment and software begins phasing out next year, meaning firms will no longer be able to fully deduct the costs of these investments from their taxable income. The temporary nature of these provisions suggests that the economic benefits are likely to be concentrated in a shorter time horizon. When it comes to reductions in the corporate tax rate, the motivation for this policy is specifically to alter the long-run incentives for firms to invest and boost productivity, rather than providing a short-term stimulus to the economy. However, many analyses of tax policy tend to focus only on the short-run impacts, typically one to two years after a policy change. This will miss many of the positive growth effects from cutting the corporate tax rate. In a new paper, a team of economists studied post-WWII U.S. federal tax policy changes to estimate their long-run impacts, looking specifically at changes in average tax rates. For personal income tax cuts, they found large and significant effects on GDP for the first six quarters, but none after two years. But for corporate income tax cuts, the short-run impacts on the economy were small while the long-run impacts were strong, peaking after eight years. Personal income tax changes had temporary impacts on productivity and an insignificant effect in research and development (R&D)\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2018/06/28/usda-report-highlights-benefits-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-farmers\",\n    \"snippet\": \"USDA Report Highlights Benefits of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for Farmers USDA Report Highlights Benefits of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for Farmers Release & Contact Info (Washington, D.C., June 28, 2018) – U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue today highlighted a new report showing the positive impacts of President Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) on American farms. Six months after the President signed the tax cuts and reforms into law, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Economic Research Service (ERS) has released a report, titled “Estimated Effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on Farms and Farm Households” (PDF, 3.5 MB). The report examines in detail how the historic tax cuts and reforms will alleviate the tax burden on American farms to help them grow and prosper. According to the report, average tax rates are expected to decline across all farm sizes and commodity specializations and fewer farm estates will be subject to the Death Tax. “Most family farms are run as small businesses, and they should be able to keep more of what they earn to reinvest in their operations and take care of their families,” Perdue said. “Simplifying the tax code and easing the burden on farmers will free them up to make choices for themselves, create jobs, and boost the overall American economy. This report just shows what we knew all along: the tax cuts and reforms will benefit farmers.” The TCJA significantly reformed the Federal income tax system, including individual and business income tax rates, business expenses, taxable income deductions, and the alternative minimum tax. The TCJA also doubled the Federal estate tax exclusion.

Our results have important implications for current debates around the economic consequences of taxing the rich, as they provide strong evidence that cutting taxes on the rich increases top income shares, but has little effect on economic performance. These findings are in line with a growing pool of macro-level panel studies on the economic consequences of cutting top marginal rates of income taxation (Angelopoulos et al., 2007; Piketty et al., 2014), as well as Rubolino and Waldenström’s (2020) synthetic control analysis of major tax cuts for the rich in Australia, New Zealand and Norway. One open question is why our findings differ from the small number of studies that have found that higher top marginal income tax rates and tax progressivity adversely affect economic growth (Padovano and Galli, 2002; Gemmell et al., 2014)? One reason could be our more comprehensive approach that takes different taxes into account when measuring tax cuts for the rich. We have argued that this approach has several advantages over relying on single tax rates and indicators. Our results also hold, however, when using statutory tax rates as the main independent variable (as in Gemmell et al., 2014). Hence, the most likely reason for the difference in our findings is that we utilize new methods for causal inference with pooled time series data (Imai et al., 2021). In contrast to the methods used in previous work, this approach combines matching methods with a difference-in-differences design. This enables us to (a) identify the effect of tax cuts in the potential outcomes framework, (b) estimate varying treatment effects over time, and (c) check the covariate balance, previous treatment trajectories and the parallel trends assumption. This approach therefore allows us, unlike previous research, to estimate generalizable and dynamic causal effects of tax cuts. In sum, this study finds that major tax cuts for the rich push up income inequality, but do not boost economic performance.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/articles/two-years-tax-cuts-continue-boosting-united-states-economy/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Two Years On, Tax Cuts Continue Boosting the United States ...

TCJA’s pro-growth reforms of individual and corporate taxes were the largest tax cut in United States history. Additionally, since TCJA’s passage, United States multinational enterprises have repatriated $1 trillion in past overseas earnings that were previously invested abroad. Prior to TCJA’s passage, CEA made a number of predictions about the legislation’s long-term effects on economic growth, business investment, wages, and the labor market. Though TCJA’s full economic benefits will require additional time to materialize, CEA’s projections have been largely borne out. A major TCJA provision allows businesses to immediately and fully deduct the cost of new capital investments, enabling them to invest more in their operations. CEA predicted an initial increase in the investment growth rate during the transition to an elevated steady state. Investment levels have been notably higher in the post-TCJA period than Blue Chip’s pre-TCJA projections from October 2016. In 2018, investment was 4.5 percent higher than the projections. In 2019, investment was 3.3 percent higher than the projections and the capital stock is on track to expand across each major asset class (equipment, structures, and intellectual property products). Additionally, TCJA provided much needed tax relief for America’s small businesses by letting certain pass-through entities deduct 20 percent of their qualified business income. As a result, over 80 percent of small firms believe that TCJA had a significant impact on the economy and over 50 percent believe it had a positive effect on their business, according to the National Federation of Independent Business.

American workers and their families are experiencing the benefits of pro-growth policies that are generating booming job creation and wage growth.

This is important because economic models that suggest that corporate income tax rate cuts could translate into large wage gains essentially require economies be small and open. If the data show that even individual U.S. states see little correlation between corporate rate cuts and wage growth, it is almost impossible to credibly claim that a cut in the federal corporate rate for the entire—clearly not “small and open”—U.S. economy would deliver wage growth. Figure 6 shows the change in state corporate income tax rates from 1980 to 2010 and the change in the inflation-adjusted state median wage in that period. There is no correlation at all visible in the data.

Finding solutions to these issues requires action in multiple areas, among them trade, education, and health. In the latest economic assessment of the U.S. economy , the IMF and U.S. authorities have also mentioned tax policy as an important lever. Our paper looks more closely at the notion that tax reforms—and individual income tax cuts in particular—can go a long way in solving these challenges. But how far can a tax cut really take you? Can a personal income tax cut boost growth? And if it does, can it boost it enough to not weigh on the budget? More importantly, will the benefits of the reform reach low and middle-income households? Our paper assesses the dynamic effects of lowering effective personal income tax rates on income distribution and the U.S. economy. We do so based on modern tools for quantitative macroeconomic analysis, relying on a model capturing salient features of the United States that are key for the question at hand; namely, different types of households (differentiated by education level), different productive sectors (manufacturing and services) interlinked through a realistic input-output structure, and international trade. In addition, and contrary to standard incidence analyses, our approach incorporates dynamics and forward looking behavior, which allows us to consider the medium-term effects of policy changes. Three key results emerge from our analysis. First, although we find that tax cuts provide a one-time boost to GDP, consumption, and investment, these effects are never strong enough to prevent a loss of revenue. Thus, tax cuts would need to be financed either through increasing the public debt, cutting spending, or by raising revenues from other taxes.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d8\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.lse.ac.uk/News/Latest-news-from-LSE/2020/L-December/Tax-cuts-for-the-rich\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Keeping tax low for rich does not boost economy News Keeping tax low for the rich does not boost economy Our research shows that the economic case for keeping taxes on the rich low is weak - Dr David Hope Major reforms reducing taxes on the rich lead to higher income inequality but do not have any significant effect on economic growth or unemployment, according to new research by LSE and King’s College London. Researchers say governments seeking to restore public finances following the COVID-19 crisis should therefore not be concerned about the economic consequences of higher taxes on the rich. The paper, published by LSE’s International Inequalities Institute, uses data from 18 OECD countries, including the UK and the US, over the last five decades. The Economic Consequences of Major Tax Cuts for the Rich, by David Hope and Julian Limberg, shows that the last 50 years were a period of falling taxes on the rich in the advanced economies. Major tax cuts were spread across countries and throughout the observation period but were particularly clustered in the late 1980s. It states: “Our results show that…major tax cuts for the rich increase the top 1% share of pre-tax national income in the years following the reform. The magnitude of the effect is sizeable; on average, each major reform leads to a rise in top 1% share of pre-tax national income of 0.8 percentage points. The results also show that economic performance, as measured by real GDP per capita and the unemployment rate, is not significantly affected by major tax cuts for the rich. The estimated effects for these variables are statistically indistinguishable from zero.” It continues: “Our findings on the effects of growth and unemployment provide evidence against supply side theories that suggest lower taxes on the rich will induce labour supply responses from high-income individuals (more hours of work, more effort etc.) that boost economic activity. They are, in fact, more in line with recent empirical research showing that income tax holidays and windfall gains do not lead individuals to significantly alter the amount they work.”\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d9\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/video-ahead-of-tax-day-young-highlights-tax-reforms-positive-impact-in-indiana\",\n    \"snippet\": \"VIDEO: Ahead of Tax Day, Young Highlights Tax Reform's Positive ...

The unemployment rate for women in particular matches the lowest rate since 1953. And jobless claims have recently dropped to the lowest level since 1969. Additionally, manufacturing job creation was the highest in 2018 that it has been in over twenty years. As the most manufacturing intensive state in the nation, this is particularly good news for people in my home state of Indiana. Last year, in conjunction with Tax Day, I spoke on the Senate Floor about the many stories that had already poured into my office – from Indiana businesses who are paying their workers more and constituents who are earning more. This year, I’m proud to say that these stories continue. My guest to last year’s State of the Union, Chelsee Hatfield, is a prime example.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d10\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/archive/4-8-08tax.htm\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Senate Housing Legislation Highly Disappointing: Less Than One ... 2009. This provision would effectively prevent localities from raising property tax rates to help compensate for shrinking property tax revenues caused by falling home values. As a result, the Senate bill could force many hard-pressed localities to cut police, firefighting, schools, and other basic public services. This provision would represent an inappropriate federal intrusion into local taxing authority. It also would intensify pressure on state governments to help make up the lost local revenue, despite the fact that many states are facing serious budget problems of their own. States — unlike the federal government — must balance their budgets, even during recessions. In dealing with the current economic problems, a first principle for Congress should be to “do no harm.” Due to its effects on local governments, this provision fails that minimal test.[18] This provision also would place unprecedented demands on the IRS and likely would be impossible for the IRS to administer. At least 40,000 towns, counties, and school districts levy property taxes, and in many cases, their boundaries do not correspond to other boundary measures such as zip codes. It would take a Herculean effort for the IRS to try to determine which tax filers live in areas that make them eligible for the tax deduction and which filers do not. Tax Cut Provisions Entirely Unrelated to the Housing Crisis The previous section of this analysis examined the $10.5 billion in tax cuts contained in the Senate bill that are supposed to be related to the foreclosure crisis but would actually provide little help in averting foreclosures (and in some cases, would likely have adverse effects). Another $9.8 billion in tax cuts in the Senate bill do not even purport to be related to housing or foreclosures. The bulk of these unrelated tax cuts — $8.3 billion of them — consist of measures to extend various tax incentives for renewable energy. These provisions appear to have been added to the housing bill as a way to circumvent the Pay-As-You-Go budget rules that require such measures to be paid for.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d11\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/02/text/20080211-8.html\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Press Briefing by Edward Lazear, Chairman, Council of Economic ... At the same time, we are cognizant that not all Americans benefit to the same extent from open trade policies. The President continues to support programs and reforms in programs like Trade Adjustment Assistance that help those whose jobs are displaced as a result of trade. Health care has been an important focus of the President. The President's plan for standard deduction would remove the disadvantage felt by consumers who buy their health care outside their employers. It would allow consumers to benefit from cost saving in the plan that they choose and in the amount of medical treatment that they purchase. It would help provide coverage for several million uninsured and it would encourage competition that will drive costs down. Government-paid Medicare costs are a significant threat to fiscal stability and the President's plan is a step in the direction of bringing these costs down. This year's report provides a number of observations on taxes. First, the ratio of tax revenue to GDP in 2007 was 18.8 percent, which is above the 40-year historic average of 18.3 percent. Second, failing to extend the President's tax cuts will have adverse consequences for the economy. Low taxes are important for creating an environment conducive to continued economic growth. Equally significant is that allowing the tax cuts to expire will result in 116 million Americans facing tax increases of an average of about $1,800. Finally, the tax cuts help move to a more efficient tax system with respect to saving and business investment. Our infrastructure is an important factor in economic growth. One chapter explores the current state of our roads, bridges, railways, telecommunications and aviation systems, and explores policies in these important areas. Alternative energy is also a major thrust of the President's policies. The 20-in-10 legislation that he proposed in last year's State of the Union was passed by Congress.

If there were no taxes on labor and capital income, individuals and firms would allocate their resources where they are most productive. Taxes encourage individuals to lower their tax burdens by avoiding activities that are taxed, thereby distorting the efficient allocation of resources. For example, taxes on labor income reduce the reward from working. Taxes on capital income reduce the reward from saving and investing. Pro-growth tax policy aims to reduce economic distortions. In 2001, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (EGTRRA) reduced individual income tax rates, created a new 10% bracket rate, provided marriage penalty relief, and began a phase-out of the estate tax. In 2003, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA) reduced the tax rates on dividends and long-term capital gains. It also accelerated the phase-in of the tax rate reductions scheduled to occur under EGTRRA.1 These tax cuts have reduced distortions to labor supply, saving, and investment decisions by lowering the tax burden on labor and capital income. They have also resulted in a more efficient tax structure by reducing the double taxation of corporate income. However, the economic benefits of the tax cuts are limited because they are scheduled to expire at the end of 2010. Making the tax cuts permanent could greatly improve long-run economic performance. Key Findings The 2001 and 2003 tax cuts have substantially reduced the tax burden on labor and capital income, thereby increasing the rewards from working, saving, and investing. The 2003 reduction in the dividend and capital gains tax rates improved the business tax structure by reducing the tax bias in favor of retaining earnings relative to paying out dividends, and using debt rather than equity to finance new investments.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d13\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/administration/eop/cea/speeches-testimony/impact-of-the-recovery-act-and-economic-outlook\",\n    \"snippet\": \"The Impact of the Recovery Act and the Economic Outlook | The ... The Recovery Act and other actions have helped to turn the economy from freefall to recovery. But, much work obviously remains to return the economy to full health. I will discuss the role that the targeted actions currently being discussed by Congress could play in counteracting some of the headwinds to growth that have become more apparent in recent weeks and, by doing so, in accelerating the rate of recovery. Impact of the Recovery Act Let me begin by discussing what the CEA’s new report finds about the impact of the Recovery Act as of the second quarter of 2010. With the Chair’s permission, I would like to enter a full copy of the report into the record. The Changing Composition of Recovery Act Stimulus. Congress designed the Recovery Act both to begin spending out quickly and to provide crucial support to the economy over a two-year period. It has met and is continuing to meet these goals. The state fiscal relief, payments to seniors, and the emergency unemployment insurance benefits went out almost immediately, and started aiding the economy in the spring and summer of 2009. The tax cuts also went into effect immediately, but it has been during tax season (the first two quarters of this year) that many Americans have seen concrete signs in the form of reduced tax payments and increased tax refunds. The Internal Revenue Service estimates that more than 95 million households received the Making Work Pay tax credit from the Recovery Act and that average tax refunds were up by over $200 from last year in part because of this and other Recovery Act tax provisions. In previous CEA Recovery Act reports, we have highlighted the state fiscal relief and the tax cuts and income support provisions of the Act, and found evidence of their effectiveness. In today’s quarterly report, we highlight the public investment spending in the Recovery Act. This is the project spending that not only creates jobs in the short run, but leaves us with an expanded and improved ability to create high-paying jobs in the future. The Recovery Act includes $319 billion of public investment on everything from basic infrastructure such as roads and bridges to twenty-first century infrastructure such as a smarter electrical grid and universal broadband.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  }\n]\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"New research finds that corporate income tax cuts produce large and persistent positive effects on the economy in the long run.\",\n    \"quote\": \"New research finds that while the benefits of personal income tax cuts are often concentrated in the short run, corporate income tax cuts generate “large and persistent” positive effects on the economy in the long run.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The snippet explicitly states that corporate tax cuts have large and persistent positive long-run effects on the economy, directly addressing the query.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"low\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"verdict\": \"partially supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"A USDA report highlighted that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would benefit farmers and boost the overall American economy.\",\n    \"quote\": \"“Simplifying the tax code and easing the burden on farmers will free them up to make choices for themselves, create jobs, and boost the overall American economy.

Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON. The rest is plain text.\n- ≥80% of final-answer sentences include [dX] (unless abstaining).\n- Use an EM DASH \" — \" in the label line (not hyphen or en dash).\n- Be precise and faithful; no new facts; respect length budgets.\n\nInputs:\n\n- query:\n{query}\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n{retrieved_docs}\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n{per_doc_notes}\n\nTask:\n1) Follow the full OUTPUT CONTRACT exactly.\n   • <think> block with:\n       (A) VALID JSON array for EVERY doc d1…dN (order-preserving, one object per doc; if verdict==\"irrelevant\" set key_fact=\"\")\n       (B) Conflict reasoning FIRST: cluster docs, reference doc IDs, and NAME the mechanism (temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive)\n       (C) ONE label line: \"<ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\"\n       (D) Brief reasoning connecting evidence to the final answer (or abstention)\n   • ONE blank line\n   • Final answer (or exactly \"CANNOT ANSWER, INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\" if abstaining)\n   • Final sentinel line [[END-OF-ANSWER]].\n\nReminders (DO NOT PRINT):\n- Reason FIRST for the conflict: write the analysis in (B), THEN emit the label line in (C); the label must be a direct consequence of the reasoning.\n- Conflict taxonomy (strict): No conflict / Complementary information / Conflicting opinions or research outcomes / Conflict due to outdated information / Conflict due to misinformation.\n- Use only existing doc_ids in bracketed citations [dX]; no ranges like d1–d5; never cite out-of-bounds [dK].\n- Prefer high-credibility sources and order citations high→low in the evidence list.\n- If any doc is \"supports\" or \"partially supports\", DO NOT abstain.\n- Close </think> before the answer; no extra text outside the required format."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Inputs:\n\n- query:\nwhen did the first settlers arrive\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/amerbegin/settlement/text1/text1read.htm\",\n    \"snippet\": \"1.

Alerts In Effect Contact Us A Short History of Jamestown On December 6, 1606, the journey to Virginia began on three ships: the Susan Constant, the Godspeed, and the Discovery. In 1607, 104 English men and boys arrived in North America to start a settlement. On May 13 they picked Jamestown, Virginia for their settlement, which was named after their King, James I. The settlement became the first permanent English settlement in North America. The site for Jamestown was picked for several reasons, all of which met criteria the Virginia Company, who funded the settlement, said to follow in picking a spot for the settlement. The site was surrounded by water on three sides (it was not fully an island yet) and was far inland; both meant it was easily defensible against possible Spanish attacks. The water was also deep enough that the English could tie their ships at the shoreline - good parking! The site was also not inhabited by the Native population. Once the spot was chosen the instructions sent by the Virginia Company, with the list of the council members (chosen by officials in England), was read. The names were kept in a sealed box on the ship (each ship had a sealed copy). The first President of the new Virginia colony was to be Edward Maria Winfield. The other six council members were: Bartholomew Gosnold, Christopher Newport, John Martin, John Ratcliffe, George Kendall, and John Smith. By June 15, the fort was completed. It was triangle shaped with a bulwark at each corner, holding four or five pieces of artillery. The settlers were now protected against any attacks that might occur from the local Powhatan Indians, whose hunting land they were living on. Relations had already been mixed between the newcomers and the Powhatan Indians. On June 22, Captain Newport left for England to get more supplies for the new settlement. Not long after Captain Newport left, the settlers began to succumb to a variety of diseases. They were drinking water from the salty or slimy river, which was one of several things that caused the death of many. The death tolls were high.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2023-08-03\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_history_of_the_United_States\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Colonial history of the United States - Wikipedia The first colonists arrived in 1733.

However the Dutch landholdings remained, and the Hudson River Valley maintained a traditional Dutch character until the 1820s.[38][39] Traces of Dutch influence remain in present-day northern New Jersey and southeastern New York State, such as homes, family surnames, and the names of roads and whole towns. The colony of New Sweden introduced Lutheranism to America in the form of some of the continent's oldest European churches.[40] The colonists also introduced the log cabin to America, and numerous rivers, towns, and families in the lower Delaware River Valley region derive their names from the Swedes.

During this era, English proto-nationalism and national assertiveness blossomed under the threat of Spanish invasion, assisted by a degree of Protestant militarism and the energy of Queen Elizabeth. At this time, however, there was no official attempt by the English government to create a colonial empire. Rather the motivation behind the founding of colonies was piecemeal and variable. Practical considerations played their parts, such as commercial enterprise, over-crowding, and the desire for freedom of religion. The main waves of settlement came in the 17th century. After 1700, most immigrants to Colonial America arrived as indentured servants, young unmarried men and women seeking a new life in a much richer environment.[43] The consensus view among economic historians and economists is that the indentured servitude occurred largely as \\\"an institutional response to a capital market imperfection,\\\" but that it \\\"enabled prospective migrants to borrow against their future earnings in order to pay the high cost of passage to America. \\\"[44] Between the late 1610s and the American Revolution,\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2025-01-09\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/united-states-history-primary-source-timeline/colonial-settlement-1600-1763/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Colonial Settlement, 1600s - 1763 | U.S. History Primary Source ...

They fought alongside the natives in local power struggles and maintained good relationships with them, establishing crucial trade networks with the native people of the Americas. The French traders and explorers were some of the first Europeans to encounter most of modern North America. In the late 17th century, they also extended south, founding the colony of Louisiana in 1682. For most of the early colonial period, the French interests in the Americas were in fur trapping and trading with the indigenous people, although they also hunted for gold and other treasures. British Settlements The first British settlement in North America was St. John's, in Newfoundland, Canada around 1520. However, it could not sustain a year-round population until 1620, a century later. The first major attempt to create a British colony in the modern-day United States was at Roanoke, in present day North Carolina in 1587. Historians call this the 'lost colony', so you may be able to guess how that turned out. By the time a ship arrived with fresh supplies in 1590, the colony was abandoned and the people gone, with their exact whereabouts and destiny serving as a longstanding historical mystery. In 1606, the British got serious and King James I formed the Virginia Company to settle North America. It did so in 1607 at Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in the Americas. Jamestown, located in Virginia, was beset by disease and starvation. The powerful Powhatan Confederacy, a coalition of Algonquin-speaking people under the leadership of Chief Powhatan, took pity on the colonists. The Powhatan, and other native allies, showed the colonists how to farm, hunt, and basically how to survive. The fact that the English colonists were starving in one of the most naturally abundant places on the continent must have seemed strange to the natives, but the English did not arrive prepared to farm.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2015-04-02\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d6\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_European_colonization_of_North_America\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Timeline of the European colonization of North America - Wikipedia 1493: Columbus arrives in Puerto Rico; 1494: Columbus arrives in Jamaica. 1496: Santo Domingo, the first European permanent settlement, is built. 1497 ... 1600: By 1600 Spain and Portugal were still the only significant colonial powers.

thus, the answer integrates these complementary contexts to present a complete timeline of first arrivals.\n</think>\n\nEvidence shows that the timing of the first settlers’ arrival depends on context. The earliest human settlers reached North America between 19,000 and 26,000 years ago [d5]. The first European settlers, led by Columbus, established a settlement on Hispaniola in 1493 [d1][d6]. Later, English settlers arrived in Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607, marking the first permanent English colony in North America [d2][d4][d8][d9]. Additional regional settlements followed, such as the founding of Georgia in 1733 [d3][d7].\n[[END-OF-ANSWER]]"}]}

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array;

The Great Society program became Johnson’s agenda for Congress in January 1965: aid to education, attack on disease, Medicare, urban renewal, beautification, conservation, development of depressed regions, a wide-scale fight against poverty, control and prevention of crime and delinquency, removal of obstacles to the right to vote.

In 1964, with Hubert Humphrey as his running mate, Johnson won the Presidency against Republican challenger, Barry Goldwater, garnering 61 percent of the vote and had the widest popular margin in American history—more than 15,000,000 votes. President Johnson used his 1964 mandate to bring his vision for a Great Society to fruition in 1965, pushing forward a sweeping legislative agenda that would become one of the most ambitious and far-reaching in the nation's history. Congress, at times augmenting or amending Johnson's legislation, rapidly enacted his recommendations. As a result, his administration passed more than sixty education bills, initiated a wide-scale fight against poverty, saw federal support of the arts and humanities, championed urban renewal, environmental beautification and conservation, enabled development of depressed regions and pushed for control and prevention of crime and delinquency. Millions of elderly people were also given the means for proper medical care through the 1965 Medicare Amendment to the Social Security Act. Johnson's Great Society also included the continued advancement of civil rights. He realized the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which removed poll taxes and tests that represented an obstacle to the ballot among many Americans of color, and the Civil Rights Act of 1968, preventing discrimination in housing sales and rentals. Additionally, he appointed the first African American cabinet member, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Robert Weaver, and first African American U.S. Supreme Court Justice, Thurgood Marshall.

Editorial Note On July 28, 1965, President Johnson opened a mid-day press conference at the White House with a statement in which he explained that U.S. involvement in the conflict in Vietnam would be expanded. He stated that the United States intended “to convince the Communists that we cannot be defeated by force of arms or by superior power.” He said that General Westmoreland had outlined the forces needed to meet the “mounting aggression” in South Vietnam, and he added: “We will meet his needs.” He had therefore ordered U.S. forces in Vietnam increased from 75,000 to 125,000, and he noted that additional forces would be dispatched as they were requested. To meet the necessary increase in active forces, the draft call would be raised over a period of time from 17,000 to 35,000 per month. The President reiterated that the United States was ready at any time for unconditional discussions to move the conflict from the battlefield to the conference table. The transcript is printed in Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: Lyndon B. Johnson, 1965, Book II, pages 794-796.

Under Johnson, the country made spectacular explorations of space in a program he had championed since its start. He strongly supported NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) as both a senator and president. In 1973, NASA’s Center for Human Spaceflight was renamed the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. Like previous presidents, Johnson remained concerned about communist containment. Johnson's largely secret efforts to broker a settlement in the ongoing war in Vietnam were fruitless. Instead, the war escalated, increasing to 500,000 American troops involved in the conflict. Controversy over the war was acute by the end of March 1968, when he limited the bombing of North Vietnam in order to initiate formal negotiations. At the same time, he startled the world by withdrawing as a candidate for reelection. Some suspected that Johnson had dropped out to escape defeat. He insisted that he wished to devote his full energies to seeking peace. Before Johnson died of a heart attack on his Texas ranch in January 1973, one of the last calls he received was from President Nixon, suggesting that a Vietnam peace agreement was about to be signed. Later, Americans lauded Johnson for his herculean efforts to change American society for the better, while regretting his expansion of the country's military commitment in Southeast Asia.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON. The rest is plain text.\n- ≥80% of final-answer sentences include [dX] (unless abstaining).\n- Use an EM DASH \" — \" in the label line (not hyphen or en dash).\n- Be precise and faithful; no new facts; respect length budgets.\n\nInputs:\n\n- query:\n{query}\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n{retrieved_docs}\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n{per_doc_notes}\n\nTask:\n1) Follow the full OUTPUT CONTRACT exactly.\n   • <think> block with:\n       (A) VALID JSON array for EVERY doc d1…dN (order-preserving, one object per doc; if verdict==\"irrelevant\" set key_fact=\"\")\n       (B) Conflict reasoning FIRST: cluster docs, reference doc IDs, and NAME the mechanism (temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive)\n       (C) ONE label line: \"<ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\"\n       (D) Brief reasoning connecting evidence to the final answer (or abstention)\n   • ONE blank line\n   • Final answer (or exactly \"CANNOT ANSWER, INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\" if abstaining)\n   • Final sentinel line [[END-OF-ANSWER]].\n\nReminders (DO NOT PRINT):\n- Reason FIRST for the conflict: write the analysis in (B), THEN emit the label line in (C); the label must be a direct consequence of the reasoning.\n- Conflict taxonomy (strict): No conflict / Complementary information / Conflicting opinions or research outcomes / Conflict due to outdated information / Conflict due to misinformation.\n- Use only existing doc_ids in bracketed citations [dX]; no ranges like d1–d5; never cite out-of-bounds [dK].\n- Prefer high-credibility sources and order citations high→low in the evidence list.\n- If any doc is \"supports\" or \"partially supports\", DO NOT abstain.\n- Close </think> before the answer; no extra text outside the required format."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Inputs:\n\n- query:\ncost of plumber\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.thisoldhouse.com/plumbing/reviews/plumbing-cost\",\n    \"snippet\": \"How Much Does Plumbing Cost? - This Old House The average plumbing job usually costs between $150 and $500.

How Much Does a Plumber Cost by Repair Type? Of course, plumbers perform a wide variety of repairs and maintenance jobs, and some can be time-consuming and costly. A clog or leak under the sink will fall on the low end of the cost spectrum, whereas a leak in your home’s main line may cost thousands of dollars to locate and repair. Plumbers may charge flat rates for common plumbing projects like installations. In some circumstances, the urgency of a job can mean you’re more likely to pay emergency rates to have a plumber fix a problem as soon as possible. You can live with a broken garbage disposal for a few weeks. But if a pipe bursts, you’ll need a plumber immediately to prevent or minimize damage to your home.

Paying attention to your expected service cost lets homeowners budget for upcoming fixes and recognize suspicious pricing (whether too high or too low). For plumber service, it’s important to understand how much plumbers charge for their services and why – and that’s something we’ll discuss this month. How Much Does a Plumber Cost in Florida? The cost for a qualified plumber ranges from $45 to $200 per hour according to HomeAdvisor, with an average of about $330. In Florida, our cost of living is slightly lower – so an average job is closer to $309. However, this range depends on the job type, timing, and quality of the plumber. Overall, common plumbing jobs end up costing $177 to $483 as long as you aren’t making any major replacements, shower installations, or re-piping. What Factors into Plumbing Repair Cost From small plumbing repairs to big projects, several things factor into plumbing prices. The cost of a service call varies from plumbing company to plumbing contractor depending on who you call. These factors help explain why there’s no flat rate per job and the difference between inexpensive plumbers and professionals. Type of Plumbing Service As you can imagine, there’s a big difference between fixing leaky faucets and remodeling projects. Your kitchen sink, main sewer line, garbage disposal, septic tank, water heater, gas lines, and other plumbing systems are all so varied that costs vary depending on what kind of project you have. Basic repairs and plumbing problems will be cheaper – but don’t expect the same for a new shower install. The same is true for residential plumbers and commercial plumbers. Commercial properties have distinct licensing and plumbing rates from residential contractors since the systems, local building codes, and equipment are so different.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2023-12-01\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://modernize.com/plumbing/plumber-cost-per-hour\",\n    \"snippet\": \"How Much Does a Plumber Cost per Hour in 2025? - Modernize In 2025, the national average cost to hire a plumber in the U.S. ranges from $45 to $200 per hour, with most homeowners paying an average of ...\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-12-05\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d5\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://chamblissplumbing.com/san-antonio-plumbing/plumber-cost-in-texas/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"How Much Does a Plumber Cost in Texas? - Chambliss Plumbing Average plumber costs range from $180 to $2,000 depending on the service type & hourly rates are between $45-$200.

Getting familiar with all related expenses is essential. Hourly Rates When it comes to plumbers, they all come with different levels of expertise and hourly rates. Plumber hourly rates in Texas can vary significantly, from $45 per hour up to as high as $200 for master plumbers. Apprentices charge around between $45-90 an hour while journeymen will ask approximately 70-120 dollars each hour or more.

Flat-Rate Fees When it comes to plumbing services, you can find solace in Texas with flat rate fees, no matter how long the job takes. For instance, unclogging a drain might cost between $100 and $400 typically. If you go for a flat fee of only 200 dollars, then saving is on your side! Even bigger jobs like burst pipe repair could reach up to two thousand bucks, but not all rescuers wear caps. Some heroes carry wrenches offering very budget-friendly prices through their fixed rates instead.

But if you take some time to understand what influences these prices, it can save a lot of stress and hassle down the line. Plenty of components have an effect on how much money is spent – such as task difficulty, materials used and emergency scenarios are all factors that contribute just like tornadoes do during stormy days here in Texas!

Hiring a Plumber When it comes to hiring a plumber, you’ll either hire a general plumber who handles basic repairs, or a plumbing contractor who specializes in new construction and remodeling projects. General Plumber A general plumber is who you’ll call when your kitchen sink gets clogged up, or you have a leak or the toilet’s overflowing. Master plumbers typically own plumbing businesses and have the knowledge and experience to handle any problem that might occur. Plumbing Contractor A plumbing contractor handles things like remodels and new construction. They will act as a general contractor and oversee the water, sewer, and gas lines in the new construction project, hiring subcontractors to handle different aspects of the project. Hiring A Plumber Before hiring a plumber, be sure to: Get at least three estimates to compare. Ask for recommendations from family, friends, and neighbors. Read reviews and check out their previous work on HomeGuide and Google. Select companies that are insured, bonded, licensed, and have been in business for 5+ years. Avoid selecting the cheapest quote as quality may suffer. Ask for a written warranty on their work, including any parts. Avoid making large payments up front, and never pay in cash. Questions To Ask Are you licensed, bonded, and insured? How long have you been in business? Can you provide references with contact information? What hours do you work? Do you charge more for after hours and weekend jobs?\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2023-09-25\"\n  }\n]\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"The average plumbing job costs between $150 and $500, with hourly rates ranging from $25 to $200.\",\n    \"quote\": \"The average plumbing job usually costs between $150 and $500.

Specific plumbing tasks also vary in price, from small repairs costing $125 to $350 to larger jobs reaching $500 to $800 or more [d6][d9].\n[[END-OF-ANSWER]]"}]}

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array;

While in college, Bajwa started his career as a pizza delivery driver for a Papa Johns franchise and moved his way up to owning his own store in Canfield, Ohio. Bajwa now owns 192 Papa Johns stores, making him a mogul within his own franchise system. His goal? To own 500 Papa Johns units, and it's a goal he takes seriously. Bajwa graduated from the Indiana School of Technology in Fort Wayne, Indiana, with a triple degree in management, marketing and accounting. While at school, he began cleaning dishes for a restaurant before moving into a delivery role with Papa Johns. The brand has just opened its first franchise in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Bajwa had ambition, but he lacked the experience to run his own store. \\\"I started learning about the model, and I started to like it,\\\" Bajwa said. \\\"I started learning about Papa Johns (and) how the brand was built. It was an interesting story. What really affected me was the business model. It's a very simple model. It was easy to learn. \\\" Nadeem Bajwa, center, at a ribbon cutting for one of his stores.

After graduation, Bajwa never thought he'd be in the pizza industry. After all, he had four degrees. As a fresh graduate, he'd more than likely have to take a pay cut to start anew and he was already making more than that with the pizza brand. \\\"I started liking it, and when I couldn't find anything (better) out there, and I was actually happy and doing what I love … I just decided to stay with the brand and just continue to improve my skills.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Depending on your particular symptoms and the severity of your condition, your treatment plan may include a combination of the following: Medications OTC and Prescription Topical Drugs: These must be directly applied to your skin to reduce psoriasis symptoms. They contain various active ingredients and are available in different preparations such as ointments, creams, lotions, sprays, gels, and shampoos. Biologics: These drugs can help modify your immune system’s response to psoriasis triggers and are typically injected. Apremilast: This pill functions by quelling a specific enzyme responsible for triggering inflammation. Methotrexate: This aids in controlling inflammation. Cyclosporine: This is an immunosuppressant that should only be taken for a short time. Light Therapy Phototherapy or light therapy entails exposing the skin to artificial or natural UV light to help minimize psoriasis symptoms. Done consistently, the ultraviolet or UV light will help slow down skin cell growth or turnover. Because of this action, it also helps decrease inflammation signals directly related to psoriasis flares. Your dermatologist in Rogers, AR, may recommend this treatment along with suitable medicines. Psoriasis is a hereditary skin condition that is associated with periodic flare-ups in which the skin develops either red patches or white flaky scales. While there is no cure for psoriasis, several treatments are available for managing the symptoms. Some patients even experience completely clear skin as a result of treatment. Here at Northwest Arkansas Clinical Trials Center in Rogers, AR, our experienced dermatologist, Dr. Cheryl Hull, can discuss treatment options with you.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://myvision.org/eye-conditions/psoriasis-around-eyes/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Psoriasis Around the Eyes: What to Do and How to Treat | MyVision ...

However, it is important to note that overexposure to UV or UVB light can worsen the symptoms of psoriasis. Overexposure can also increase your risk of skin damage and skin cancer. As such, make sure you consult with your doctor before beginning phototherapy. Biologic therapy: This is a novel treatment approach that targets specific components of the immune system. This treatment appears to help reduce the number of flares and the severity of symptoms associated with psoriasis. When deciding whether to prescribe a biologic drug and which, your doctor will consider the type of Psoriasis you have and the severity of your symptoms. The current guidelines recommend that a biologic drug should be prescribed for moderate-to-severe symptoms of psoriasis. Eye Complications Associated with Psoriasis If you have psoriasis around the eyes, it is a good idea to see a dermatologist and an ophthalmologist regularly. Your eye specialist will check for complications that can happen more often with psoriasis including: Uveitis: Swelling in the front, middle, or back of the eye resulting in inflammation, dryness, and discomfort. Dry eye: A common complaint affecting 1 in 5 people with psoriasis. Conjunctivitis: Also called pink eye, this is an inflammation of the moist tissue covering the white of the eye. Up to two-thirds of people with psoriasis also have this condition. Blepharitis: Swelling or redness of the eyelids.

Famous practitioners like Herodotus and Hippocrates studied the health benefiting properties on body and mind. However, a modern scientific approach to photomedicine is a relatively recent development of the 19th century. Especially within the last 50 years a wide variety of diseases have been identified that can be effectively treated with phototherapy. What is Phototherapy? Phototherapy is the controlled application of light to treat psoriasis, vitiligo and other skin disorders. Skin is treated with the special light of phototherapy unit. The medical lamps in these phototherapy units emit ultraviolet (UV) light at a very precise wavelength that stimulates skin cells. In response the cells return to a normal state again, which reduces or even eliminates the symptoms of skin diseases. How does Phototherapy work? In short, regular sessions, the affected areas of the skin are treated with ultraviolet light. The skin cells are stimulated and return to their normal state. Although there is no complete cure for psoriasis, more than 80% of the patients report phototherapy treatment to significant improve or eliminate most symptoms. Therapy devices can range from compact handheld devices to complete “Walk-in” cabins for full-body treatments. Psoriasis Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect both the skin and joints. It’s not contagious and affects nearly three percent of the world’s population. If you have Psoriasis, your body excessivly produces new skin cells. This creates scaly reddened patches that often become painful and itchy. A phototherapy is a gentle low-risk treatment with excellent success rates for psoriasis. There are mainly two types of UV treatments available that differ in their spectral distribution. With UVA, doctors often combine the treament with a type medication (Psoralen). This treatment is called PUVA.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://knowyourskin.britishskinfoundation.org.uk/condition/psoriasis/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Psoriasis – British Skin Foundation This assessment will be part of your specialist reviews and it will help monitor the effects of treatment on further or follow up visits. Can psoriasis be cured? There is no cure for psoriasis. However, there are several effective treatments available to keep psoriasis well controlled. Spontaneous (or sudden, unexpected) clearance of psoriasis may occur in some people. How can psoriasis be treated? Treatment of psoriasis depends upon your individual circumstances. Treatment applied to the surface of your skin (topical treatment) is sufficient alone in most people. For individualswith more extensive or difficult to treat psoriasis, ultraviolet light treatment (phototherapy), tablet treatment or injection treatment may be required. skin_condition_infomationTopical treatments skin_condition_infomationPhototherapy Phototherapy is ultraviolet light delivered in a controlled way to treat psoriasis. A course of treatment usually takes about 8-10 weeks and will require treatment sessions two to three times a week. This usually means attending a Phototherapy Unit in a hospital. Two types of light are used: narrowband ultraviolet B light (NB-UVB/TLO1) and ultraviolet A light (PUVA). A treatment called psoralen taken as a tablet or added to a bath before treatment is required for PUVA. What can I do to help? Remember that psoriasis is an inflammatory condition. Therefore, it is important to consider lifestyle changes that will help reduce chronic inflammation in the body. Here are some suggestions on what you can do: Talk to your general practitioner (GP) or dermatologist about your psoriasis and how it impacts your daily life. Together, you can set treatment goals. Work with your GP to manage risk factors for heart disease and stroke. Adopt a healthy lifestyle by eating a balanced diet, trying to lose weight if needed, and exercising regularly. If you smoke, quitting can be beneficial.

They can be managed very effectively with trichological preparations. Scalp complaints can have underlying contributing factors and be symptomatic to stress, poor diet, allergies and metabolic issues. A scalp problem can be very uncomfortable when it flares up, creating intense itching and built up areas of scale and plaques, which can be quite distressing. Some scarring conditions can present as a scalp complaint and be extremely sore and itchy with the hair loss not noticed initially by the patient. The take home message is the sooner you seek help the better the chance of halting any damage. Below is a summary of the conditions most prevalently seen in clinic, although it is not exhaustive. Psorisis Psoriasis is a chronic disease and often affects the scalp. There are differing forms of psoriasis, it is usually plaque psoriasis that is seen on the scalp. The plaques are clearly demarcated at the margins showing a redness that differs to the normal adjacent skin. The plaques are covered with dry white, adherent silvery scales. These plaques can be difficult to remove and beneath them the skin is rough with bleeding points. For some, psoriasis can be extremely pruritic (itchy) and for others, the feeling of a tight and uncomfortable scalp. Psoriasis can have a genetic origin and it is thought to be caused by a problem with the immune system which alters the skin cell production in the areas affected. This skin disease can be impacted by factors such as stress illness and injury. It cannot be cured but it is possible to manage it with the possibility of long remissions.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Harvard geniuses, biohackers and internet billionaires are all looking for ways that humans can crack the code on aging. WaitButWhy blogger Tim Urban writes “the human body seems programmed to shut itself down somewhere around the century mark, if it hasn’t already”. And Urban is right! There are no verified cases of a person living to be older than 122, though the oldest living person is on their way at age 119. Researchers at GERO.AI concluded the “absolute limit” of the human lifespan to be between 100 and 150 – they came to this conclusion by analyzing 70,000 participants up to age 85 based on their ability to fight disease, risk of heart conditions and cognitive impairment. The Conversation reported that not a single participant showed the biological resiliency to live to 150 – but notes the study is limited by today’s medical standards. Will improvements in medicine, environment and technology to drastically lengthen the average lifespan and make 150 a reality? Humans could live until the age of 150, according to a new study. Shutterstock Brutal biology The human body is made up of about 30 trillion cells. Cells are constantly dying and being replaced by replicants. Within the cell body there are chromosomes – these are DNA strands with the code written for humans within them. At the end of a DNA strand is a microscopic bundle of non-crucial DNA, so that none of the important stuff gets snipped off when the cell divides. A cell can divide itself about 50 times before it’s lost its ability to replicate. As more and more cells become ineffective and die, the signs of aging start to show in gray hair, weaker bones and vision loss. Some theorize this process can be stopped or reversed.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/can-people-live-150-probably-not-new-study-finds-n660431\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Can People Live to 150?

But if you take those mice and keep them in captivity and optimal conditions, they die when they are two years old or so. But they die. And that is because of the aging process.” Thomas, 5, looks at Jeanne Calment after he brought her flowers at her retirement home in Arles, southern France on Feb. 12, 1997. Calment, believed to be the world's oldest person, died at the age of 122 in 1997. New research published in the journal Nature on Oct. 5, 2016 suggests there's a limit to our life span and that the odds of breaking Calment's record are small. Florian Launette / AP, file Dr. Thomas Perls of Boston Medical Center and the Boston University School of Medicine agrees. “This is all stuff many of us in the field knew. It was just a matter of putting it down on paper,” Perls told NBC News. Perls is studying so-called super-agers — people who live to be 110 or older. “We now have 150 people over 110. They are very, very rare,” Perls said. He calculates that one in 5 million people lives to be 110 or older. He thinks there is something different about them.

Humans 'not even close' to reaching the maximum ... Living to 150? Humans ‘not even close’ to reaching the maximum lifespan ATHENS, Ga. — Human lifespans are capable of soaring past the current record of 122 years, with people possibly reaching the age of 150, a new study explains. According to a researcher at the University of Georgia, we are “not even close” to reaching the maximum potential lifespan. The findings are based on an analysis of mortality rates going back more than three centuries across 19 countries. Lead author Dr. David McCarthy describes the implications as “profound.” For most of recorded human history, the average life expectancy has been between 20 and 40 years. Today, humans live to be around 80 years-old. Improved nutrition, clean water, better sanitation, and the application of medical science have been key to prolonging life. Experts suspect genetic manipulation, calorie restriction, and new medicines may extend life even further. The team in the study combined reasoning and probability – known as Bayesian theory – to work out potential maximum longevity. Results showed mortality limits have only been postponed in recent years due to records being slow to increase. “As these cohorts attain advanced ages in coming decades, longevity records may therefore increase significantly. Our results confirm prior work suggesting that if there is a maximum limit to the human lifespan, we are not yet approaching it.” (Credit: Anna Shvets from Pexels) So, how long can people really live? Two years ago, another study found life expectancy has the capacity to almost double, going beyond 150. Those findings were based on blood samples from thousands of British and American participants. “Whether or not there is a limit to the human lifespan has been a subject of debate for millennia,” Dr. McCarthy continues. “Historical estimates of the maximum possible lifespan strongly suggest it has increased substantially over recorded history.” The Bible famously records the Hebrews as regarding 80 years as the maximum length of a human life. Around 1,000 years later, the ancient Romans set their official estimate at 100 or 110.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d5\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://guardian.ng/features/why-humans-cannot-live-beyond-150-years-by-study/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Why humans cannot live beyond 150 years, by study | The Guardian ...

They developed an app to predict the maximum lifespan. The study was published in the journal Nature Communications. Experts in biology and biophysics fed an artificial intelligence system vast amounts of Deoxy ribonucleic Acid (DNA)/genetic material and medical data, on hundreds of thousands of volunteers in the United Kingdom (UK) and United States (US). This allowed them to develop an AI-driven iPhone app that, with simple input from a user, can accurately estimate the rate of biological ageing and maximum lifespan. As part of the big data study, they found there were two key parameters responsible for human lifespan, both covering lifestyle factors and how the body responds. The first factor is biological age, linked to stress, lifestyle and disease, and the second is resilience, reflecting how quickly the first factor returns to normal. This allowed the team to determine that the longest any human is likely to ever live is 150 years; almost double the current UK average lifespan of 81 years. The discovery is based on blood samples from two different longitudinal DNA studies, analysed by the team from Gero, a Singapore-based biotech company and Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, New York. When do human brains become “old”? The human brain becomes ‘old’ at just 25, research suggested in February 2017. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is found in the brain and spinal cord, changes its speed of movement in people older than their mid-20s, a Lancaster University study found. These movements are linked to breathing and heart rates, with CSF changes previously being associated with conditions such as multiple sclerosis and high blood pressure.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d6\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/10/humans-wont-ever-live-far-beyond-115-years/502967/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Humans Won't Ever Live Far Beyond 115 Years - The Atlantic 108 years in the 1990s. “Demographers said that if there’s an end in sight, they couldn’t see it,” says Vijg, who led the new study. “When Calment died at 122, everyone said it’ll only be a matter of time before we have someone who’s 125 or 130. But after Calment, there was no one else. It was 115 … 115 … 115.” To see if that perceived plateau was real, Dong, Milholland, and Vijg turned to two international databaseson longevity and worked out the oldest individuals who died in any given year. They specifically looked at France, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the U.S.—the four countries with the most supercentenarians, people who live to 110 years or more. The data were clear. Between the 1970s and early 1990s, our maximum age rose from around 110 to 115—and then stopped after 1995, shortly before Jeanne Calment died. In fact, Vijg’s team calculated that in any given year, the odds that at least one person in the world will live past their 125th birthday are less than 1 in 10,000. Despite sanitation, antibiotics, vaccines, and other medical advances, the oldest living people simply aren’t dying any later. They’re unlikely to either, regardless of calorie restriction, drugs like rapamycin, and all of our other efforts to slow the flow of sand through the hourglass. “In science, you never know,” says Vijg. “But I’ve not seen anything that I think would break through the ceiling.” The ceiling is probably hardwired into our biology. As we grow older, we slowly accumulate damage to our DNA and other molecules, which turns the intricate machinery of our cells into a creaky, dysfunctional mess. In most cases, that decline leads to diseases of old age, like cancer, heart disease, or Alzheimer’s.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d7\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.cnet.com/science/humans-probably-cant-live-past-150-years-research-finds/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Humans probably can't live longer than 150 years, new research ... Science is once again casting doubt on the idea that we could live to be nearly as old as the biblical Methuselah or Mel Brooks' famous 2,000-year-old man. New research from Singapore-base biotech company Gero looks at how well the human body bounces back from disease, accidents or just about anything else that puts stress on its systems. This basic resilience declines as people age, with an 80-year-old requiring three times as long to recover from stresses as a 40-year-old on average. This should make sense if you've ever known an elderly person who has taken a nasty fall. Recovery from such a spill can be lif- threatening for a particularly frail person, whereas a similar fall might put a person half as old out of commission for just a short time and teenagers might simply dust themselves off and keep going. Extrapolate this decline further, and human body resilience is completely gone at some age between 120 and 150, according to new analysis performed by the researchers. In other words, at some point your body loses all ability to recover from pretty much any potential stressor. The researchers arrived at this conclusion by looking at health data for large groups from the US, the UK and Russia. They looked at blood cell counts as well as step counts recorded by wearables. As people experienced different stressors, fluctuations in blood cell and step counts showed that recovery time grew longer as individuals grew older. The new research contains a certain amount of validation for the idea that humans start dying from the moment we're born, but the process seems to speed up significantly somewhere in the mid-thirties to mid-forties when the body's resilience starts to decline more steeply. The study's conclusion that the body loses all ability to cope -- or at least to recover -- from stress before age 150 is line with the conclusions of similar studies, including one from last year that pegged the maximum possible human age at 138 years.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d8\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a37144873/human-life-expectancy-limit-150-years/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Humans Could Live to Be 150, Science Says Humans Could Live to Be 150, Science Says The main factor limiting our lifespan is a loss of the ability to bounce back after a setback, called \\\"physiological resilience. \\\" Even without major health issues, like cancer, your body will eventually run out of energy to help recover from even minor challenges.

But the thing that's keeping the human body from reaching immortality is surprisingly mundane: over time, your body loses the \\\"physiological resilience,\\\" or the ability to bounce back, that you once had in your younger years.

But, the lines are not that clear. Life expectancy and lifespan are two different factors of human well-being that measure longevity. Lifespan refers to the maximum number of years an individual can live, making lifespan unique to everyone. The longest recorded lifespan was Jeanne Calment who lived for 122 years and 5 months, making the maximum possible human lifespan 122 years and 5 months – that is, until someone outlives Calment. Life expectancy, on the other hand, refers to the average age an individual can expect to live at different stages of life. As humans age, physical and cognitive challenges can emerge, making life expectancy a dynamic measurement that changes based on different experiences and lifestyles of an individual. This does not mean that 48 years-old was considered “old” in say, the 1850s. But 48 was the average age that individuals could expect to live to during that time. It turns out that infant mortality rates sharply drive down the average life expectancy in a population (i.e., the number of child deaths in certain regions is so high that there are more childhood deaths than adult deaths, lowering life expectancy for that region). You might think that, since our ability to safely manage childbirth and provide childcare has vastly improved since the 19th century, then children would have a greater chance of surviving into adolescence and even older adulthood. While yes, this is true, and yes, it has certainly contributed to an increase in the human lifespan, humans have been living well into their 70s and 80s since ancient times. For instance, a first century writer, Pliny, dedicated a chapter of The Natural History to individuals who had lived the longest during that time. In the first century, three individuals had already lived to be 100.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d10\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10946839/Anti-ageing-living-youre-200-really-isnt-pipe-dream.html\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Anti-ageing: Why living until you're 200 really isn't a pipe dream ... The idea of living for hundreds of years was once thought to be the pipe dream of billionaires and tech moguls. But scientists at the forefront of anti-ageing research believe they are on the cusp of developing a pill that could lead to people living to the age of 200 and beyond. Medical advances in the last century have led to humans in wealthy nations living into their 80s, almost double the average life expectancy at the turn of the 20th century. Improved nutrition, clean water, better sanitation and huge leaps in medicine have been key in prolonging human life. The oldest known person — the Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who sold canvases to Vincent Van Gogh when she was a girl in the late 1800s — lived to the age of 122, dying in 1997. There is some debate about whether humans can naturally live much beyond that age, but it is hoped that science will take human lifespans beyond what is currently thought possible. Dr Andrew Steele, a British computational biologist and author of a new book on longevity, told MailOnline there is no biological reason humans can't reach the age of 200. He believes the big breakthrough will come in the form of drugs that remove 'zombie cells' in the body, which are thought to be one of the main culprits of tissue and organ decay as we age. Pills that flush these cells out of the body are already in human trials in and could be on the market in as little as 10 years, according to Dr Steele, who believes someone reading this could make it to 150 with the help of the drugs. Another field in particular that piques the interest of anti-ageing scientists is the study of DNA of reptiles and other cold-blooded animals. Michigan State University experts have begun studying dozens different types of long-living reptiles and amphibians — including crocodiles, salamanders and turtles that can live as long as 120 years.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON. The rest is plain text.\n- ≥80% of final-answer sentences include [dX] (unless abstaining).\n- Use an EM DASH \" — \" in the label line (not hyphen or en dash).\n- Be precise and faithful; no new facts; respect length budgets.\n\nInputs:\n\n- query:\n{query}\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n{retrieved_docs}\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n{per_doc_notes}\n\nTask:\n1) Follow the full OUTPUT CONTRACT exactly.\n   • <think> block with:\n       (A) VALID JSON array for EVERY doc d1…dN (order-preserving, one object per doc; if verdict==\"irrelevant\" set key_fact=\"\")\n       (B) Conflict reasoning FIRST: cluster docs, reference doc IDs, and NAME the mechanism (temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive)\n       (C) ONE label line: \"<ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\"\n       (D) Brief reasoning connecting evidence to the final answer (or abstention)\n   • ONE blank line\n   • Final answer (or exactly \"CANNOT ANSWER, INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\" if abstaining)\n   • Final sentinel line [[END-OF-ANSWER]].\n\nReminders (DO NOT PRINT):\n- Reason FIRST for the conflict: write the analysis in (B), THEN emit the label line in (C); the label must be a direct consequence of the reasoning.\n- Conflict taxonomy (strict): No conflict / Complementary information / Conflicting opinions or research outcomes / Conflict due to outdated information / Conflict due to misinformation.\n- Use only existing doc_ids in bracketed citations [dX]; no ranges like d1–d5; never cite out-of-bounds [dK].\n- Prefer high-credibility sources and order citations high→low in the evidence list.\n- If any doc is \"supports\" or \"partially supports\", DO NOT abstain.\n- Close </think> before the answer; no extra text outside the required format."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Inputs:\n\n- query:\nhow many employees does mercedes benz have\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_Group\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Mercedes-Benz Group - Wikipedia The North Charleston plant had been employing only 100 workers.

Mercedes-Benz Group AG (formerly Daimler-Benz, DaimlerChrysler and Daimler) is a Germanmultinationalautomotive company headquartered in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It is one of the world's leading car manufacturers. Daimler-Benz was formed with the merger of Benz & Cie., the world's oldest car company,[4] and Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft in 1926. The company was renamed DaimlerChrysler upon the acquisition of the American automobile manufacturer, Chrysler Corporation in 1998, it was renamed to Daimler upon the divestment of Chrysler in 2007. In 2021, Daimler was the second-largest German automaker and the sixth-largest worldwide by production. In February 2022, Daimler was renamed Mercedes-Benz Group as part of a transaction that spun-off its commercial vehicle segment as an independent company, Daimler Truck. By unit sales, the Mercedes-Benz Group is the tenth-largest car manufacturer in the world; shipping two million passenger vehicles in 2021[5] and by revenue the seventh-largest car manufacturer worldwide in 2023.[6] Also in 2023, the company was ranked 42nd in the Forbes Global 2000.[7] The group provides financial services through its Mercedes-Benz Mobility arm. The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50stock market index.[8] The central company headquarters, the Mercedes-Benz offices, a car assembly plant, the Mercedes-Benz Museum and the Mercedes-Benz Arena are situated in the Mercedes-Benz complex in Stuttgart. The Mercedes-Benz Group origin is in an Agreement of Mutual Interest signed on 1 May 1924 between Benz & Cie.

Mercedes-Benz (German pronunciation:[mɛʁˌtseːdəsˈbɛnts,-dɛs-]ⓘ),[6][7] commonly referred to simply as Mercedes and occasionally as Benz, is a German luxury and commercial vehicle brand that was founded in 1926. Mercedes-Benz AG (a subsidiary of the Mercedes-Benz Group, established in 2019) is based in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany.[1] Mercedes-Benz AG manufactures luxury vehicles and light commercial vehicles, all branded under the Mercedes-Benz name. From November 2019 onwards, the production of Mercedes-Benz-branded heavy commercial vehicles (trucks and buses) has been managed by Daimler Truck, which separated from the Mercedes-Benz Group to form an independent entity at the end of 2021. In 2018, Mercedes-Benz became the world’s largest premium vehicle brand, with a sales volume of 2.31 million passenger cars.[8] Emil Jellinek-Mercedes, an Austrian automobile entrepreneur who worked with DMG, registered the trademark in 1902, naming the 1901 Mercedes 35 hp after his daughter Mercedes Jellinek. Jellinek was a businessman and marketing strategist who promoted \\\"horseless\\\" Daimler automobiles among the highest circles of society. At the time, it was a meeting place for the haute volée of France and Europe, especially in winter. His customers included the Rothschild family and other wealthy clients, but as early as 1901, he was selling Mercedes cars in the \\\"New World\\\" as well, including to billionaires Rockefeller, Astor, Morgan, and Taylor. At the Nice race he attended in 1899, Jellinek drove under the pseudonym \\\"Monsieur Mercédès\\\". Many consider that race the birth of Mercedes-Benz as a brand.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

As has been well-known for millennia, in either 587 or 586 B.C.E., the forces of Nebuchadnezzar II, king of Babylonia, served a deadly blow to the small and rebellious Kingdom of Judah. They wiped it off the map, deported large swathes of its population, and destroyed its holy temple, the Temple of Solomon. Or not. This, says renowned biblical scholar Richard Elliott Friedman, a professor of Jewish Studies at the University of Georgia and author of the best-selling book “Who Wrote the Bible?” may have been a case of mistaken identity. The Babylonians may have destroyed Judah and kicked out its populace, but they did not destroy the temple. The culprits were the Edomites, a small kingdom in the southern Transjordan, he posits. In a short article published in Academia, \\\"The Destruction of the First Jerusalem Temple,\\\" Friedman suggests that the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the temple were two separate events, which a biblical scribe collapsed into one and thus led us all to misplace the blame. At first glance this seems unlikely. The Hebrew Bible explicitly states no less than three times that the Babylonians burned down the Temple when they took the city: “Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, [came] unto Jerusalem, and he burnt the house of the Lord, and the king’s house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great man’s house burnt he with fire” (2 Kings 25:8-9 KJV; and very similarly stated in Jeremiah 52:12-13 and 2 Chronicles 36:19).

Table of Contents About The Book An investigation into the real historical figure of King David and the real location of the Temple of Solomon • Identifies King David as Pharaoh Tuthmosis III of the 18th Dynasty and David’s son Solomon as Pharaoh Amenhotep, Tuthmosis’s successor • Shows how the Temple of Solomon described in the Bible corresponds with the Mortuary Temple of Luxor in Egypt • Explains how David was not a descendant of Isaac but his father and how biblical narrators changed the original story of Abraham and Isaac to hide his Egyptian identity During the last two centuries, thousands of ancient documents from different sites in the Middle East have been uncovered. However, no archaeological discovery speaks of King David or Solomon, his son and successor, directly or in directly. Was King David a real person or a legend like King Arthur? Proposing that David was a genuine historical figure, Ahmed Osman explores how his identity may be radically different than what is described in religious texts. Drawing on recent archaeological, historical, and biblical evidence from Egypt, Osman shows that David lived in Thebes, Egypt, rather than Jerusalem; that he lived five centuries earlier than previously thought, during the 15th rather than the 10th century B.C.; and that David was not a descendant of Isaac but was, in fact, Isaac’s father. The author also reveals David’s true Egyptian identity: Pharaoh Tuthmosis III of the 18th Dynasty. Confirming evidence from rabbinic literature that indicates Isaac was not Abraham’s son, despite the version provided in Genesis, Osman demonstrates how biblical narrators replaced David with Abraham the Hebrew to hide the Egyptian identity of Isaac’s father. He shows how Egyptian historical and archaeological sources depict figures that match David’s and Solomon’s known characteristics in many ways, including accounts of a great empire between the Euphrates and the Nile that corresponds with David’s empire as described in the Bible.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/bible-study/interesting-facts-about-solomons-temple.html\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Where Was Solomon's Temple in the Bible - 7 Interesting Facts 7 Interesting Facts about Solomon's Temple In 1883, a biblical scholar, Thomas Newberry, designed a three-dimensional model of Solomon’s Temple as part of the Anglo-Jewish Historical Exhibition, heightening the interest of Jews and Christians alike in the first Jewish temple. The story of Solomon’s commitment to build a permanent house for God engages believers’ imagination. It was stately and beautiful from a human standpoint but also conceived in the heart of another king who dearly loved God. The desire to understand more about the background of its construction and the modern-day controversy surrounding its existence sends believers back to the Scriptures to discover where, how, and why it was constructed, and why God chose Solomon to build it. Here are some interesting facts Christians should know about Solomon’s Temple: Who Built Solomon's Temple? 1. Solomon Was Chosen by God to Build the Temple King David, Solomon’s father, lived in the royal palace, but he was concerned that God’s priests still had to serve Him in the 400-year-old, portable Tabernacle from the wilderness wanderings. David wanted to build a permanent house for God, and a resting place for the Ark of the Covenant (1 Chronicles 28:2). The prophet Nathan initially gave David approval to begin construction, but God spoke to Nathan in a dream. God said David would not be the one to build His house, even though David had a heart after God’s own heart. David would, however, draw up the plans and accumulate materials for the building (1 Chronicles 22:2-4; 22:14-17; 29:2-9). David was a great warrior king who united the Israelite tribes, captured Jerusalem, and chose Mount Moriah as the site for a future temple. But God said, “You will not build a house for my name for you are a man of battles and have shed blood” (1 Chron 28:3). The honor and responsibility of building the temple would go to his son, Solomon—whose name means “peace.” 2.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/pages/article/national-treasure-freemasons-fact-and-fiction\",\n    \"snippet\": \"\\\"National Treasure\\\": Freemasons, Fact, and Fiction Many Freemasons today say they are the spiritual descendants of the knights. According to legend, the Knights Templar discovered the greatest treasure in human history buried beneath the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem. What is true, scholars say, is that the knights became wealthy and powerful, and they may have rivaled the influence of some European kings. \\\"They're mysterious because they were so sensationally successful,\\\" said Lisa Bitel, a history professor at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles. \\\"The idea behind lots of these conspiracy and treasure stories is that any individual could happen upon a forgotten relic of the past, join with other like-minded mavericks, and use this relic for personal redemption or universal good.\\\" But in the early 1300s, the knights were suppressed and executed. Whether they found Solomon's treasure is not known. No treasure map has ever been found. Spoiler warning: Do not read on if you prefer not to learn a key plot development in the The Da Vinci Code. Raising Questions Although the medieval knights also feature prominently in The Da Vinci Code, it was that novel's main plot twist—that Jesus Christ married Mary Magdalene—which stirred up real controversy.

Kelly says many people are disappointed when he tells them that the marriage never happened. Yet the academic says there are many things in the book that are historically accurate, and he believes the novel serves a valuable purpose. \\\"Brown tells people something they never knew—that the early history of Christianity was much more complicated than anybody thought,\\\" he said.

Solomon is known for being the king of Israel who built the first Temple in Jerusalem. He was also the second (after his father, David) and last king of a unified Israel, which was at the height of its power during his reign. He is known for stories told in the Bible about his wisdom. What was the religion of Solomon? The religion of Solomon was Judaism, the monotheistic religion of the ancient Hebrews. However, as related in the first book of Kings, Solomon had many foreign women among his wives. “His wives turned his heart after other gods” (1 Kings 11:4, NIV), and thus he built shrines to the gods of their religions. In the biblical account of his reign, God tells Solomon he will punish him for his apostasy by breaking up his kingdom after his death. Who were Solomon’s sons? Solomon was succeeded by his son Rehoboam, who continued the harsh policies of his father toward the northern tribes of Israel. The northern tribes seceded and made Jeroboam, an official of Solomon who had led a rebellion against him, king. According to Ethiopian tradition, their emperors were descended from Menilek I, who was the son of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. Background and sources Nearly all evidence for Solomon’s life and reign comes from the Bible (especially the first 11 chapters of the First Book of Kings and the first nine chapters of the Second Book of Chronicles). According to those sources, his father was David (flourished c. 1000 bce), the poet and king who, against great odds, founded the Judaeandynasty and united all the tribes of Israel under one monarch. Solomon’s mother was Bathsheba, formerly the wife of David’s Hittite general, Uriah. She proved to be adept at court intrigue, and through her efforts, in concert with the prophet Nathan, Solomon was anointed king while David was still alive, despite the fact that he was younger than his brothers. Material evidence for Solomon’s reign, as for that of his father, is scant.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d6\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-sites-places/biblical-archaeology-sites/searching-for-the-temple-of-king-solomon/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Searching for the Temple of King Solomon - Biblical Archaeology ... Searching for the Temple of King Solomon For centuries, scholars have searched in vain for any remnant of Solomon’s Temple.

Fortunately, several Iron Age temples discovered throughout the Levant bear a striking resemblance to the Temple of King Solomon in the Bible. Through these remains, we gain extraordinary insight into the architectural grandeur of the building that stood atop Jerusalem’s Temple Mount nearly 3,000 years ago. The black basalt ruins of the Iron Age temple discovered at ’Ain Dara in northern Syria offer the closest known parallel to the Temple of King Solomon in the Bible. Photo: Ben Churcher. As reported by archaeologist John Monson in the pages of BAR, the closest known parallel to the Temple of King Solomon is the ’Ain Dara temple in northern Syria. Nearly every aspect of the ’Ain Dara temple—its age, its size, its plan, its decoration—parallels the vivid description of the Temple of King Solomon in the Bible. In fact, Monson identified more than 30 architectural and decorative elements shared by the ’Ain Dara structure and the Jerusalem Temple described by the Biblical writers.

It stands against claims that invert the truth, according to which “the legend of the bogus Temple is the greatest crime of historical forgery,” and against entire books that have been written in that vein. In his book History of the Prophets and Kings, al-Tabari refers several more times to the Temple Mount as the site of the Temple, and also identified Isaac, not Ishmael, as the hero of the “Binding of Isaac” story. The famous commentator described David’s and Solomon’s involvement in building a mosque on the Temple Mount in a way that corresponds exactly, in not a few details, to the Bible’s description of the process of building the Temple. This description is typical of other, similar descriptions in Islam that point to a strong, ongoing connection to Jewish traditions. David wanted to begin building the mosque and Allah disclosed to him: It is indeed a sacred structure. You defiled your hands with blood and will not build. But you will have a son whom I will coronate after you and his name will be Solomon. Him I will cleanse of the blood. When King Solomon built the mosque and sanctified it, David was a hundred years old, when he heard of the Prophet Muhammad…. The period of his kingship was forty years. For al-Tabari, Solomon (Suleiman ibn Daud [David]) is the main prophet responsible for the construction on the Mount, where the Muslims built their mosques. The Muslim geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi, who visited Jerusalem in the 12th century, likewise described “the Temple Mount that Solomon ben David built.” He added that “in the vicinity of the eastern gate of the gates to the Dome of the Rock is the shrine that was called the Holy of Holies, and it is impressive to look upon.”\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  }\n]\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"verdict\": \"partially supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"The article discusses differing scholarly views on who destroyed the Temple of Solomon, implying debate about its historical details rather than its existence.\",\n    \"quote\": \"Friedman suggests that the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the temple were two separate events, which a biblical scribe collapsed into one and thus led us all to misplace the blame.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The snippet addresses the Temple of Solomon’s destruction, not its existence, offering partial relevance to the query.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"high\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"verdict\": \"partially supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"The snippet discusses a theory that the Temple of Solomon described in the Bible corresponds with the Mortuary Temple of Luxor in Egypt, implying a possible real-world basis.\",\n    \"quote\": \"Shows how the Temple of Solomon described in the Bible corresponds with the Mortuary Temple of Luxor in Egypt\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The snippet is on-topic and presents a theory linking the biblical temple to a real Egyptian site, but it does not definitively confirm the temple’s historical existence.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"low\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"verdict\": \"partially supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"The snippet discusses Solomon’s Temple and mentions modern-day controversy surrounding its existence.\",\n    \"quote\": \"The desire to understand more about the background of its construction and the modern-day controversy surrounding its existence sends believers back to the Scriptures to discover where, how, and why it was constructed, and why God chose Solomon to build it.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The text is on-topic about Solomon’s Temple and notes controversy over its existence but does not confirm whether it was real.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"low\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"verdict\": \"irrelevant\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The snippet discusses legends about the Knights Templar and the Temple of Solomon but provides no information on whether the Temple of Solomon actually existed.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"high\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d5\",\n    \"verdict\": \"partially supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"The Britannica entry notes that Solomon is known for building the first Temple in Jerusalem, but also states that material evidence for his reign is scant.\",\n    \"quote\": \"Solomon is known for being the king of Israel who built the first Temple in Jerusalem. ...

Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain;

then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Is it an allergy? Lactose intolerance isn't the same as a milk or dairy allergy. Food allergies are caused by your immune system reacting to a certain type of food. This causes symptoms such as a rash, wheezing and itching. If you're allergic to something, even a tiny particle can be enough to trigger a reaction, while most people with lactose intolerance can still consume small amounts of lactose without experiencing any problems (although this varies from person to person). Treating lactose intolerance There's no cure for lactose intolerance, but limiting your intake of food and drink containing lactose usually helps to control the symptoms. Depending on what dairy products you're able to eat, you may also require additional calcium and vitamin D supplements to keep your bones strong and healthy. In some cases, your GP may refer you to a dietitian for further advice. In addition to dietary changes, lactase substitutes may also be helpful. These are drops or tablets you can take with your meals or drinks to improve your digestion of lactose. Complications of lactose intolerance Milk and other dairy products contain calcium, protein and vitamins such as A, B12 and D. Lactose also helps your body absorb a number of other minerals, such as magnesium and zinc. These vitamins and minerals are important for the development of strong, healthy bones. If you're lactose intolerant, getting the right amount of important vitamins and minerals can prove difficult. This may lead to unhealthy weight loss and put you at increased risk of developing the following conditions: Osteopenia – where you have a very low bone-mineral density. If osteopenia is not treated, it can develop into osteoporosis.

Those who avoid dairy products because of allergies or for other reasons can obtain calcium from non-dairy sources, such as some vegetables (e.g., kale, broccoli, and Chinese cabbage [bok choi]), canned fish with bones, or fortified foods (e.g., fruit juices, breakfast cereals, and tofu) [1]. However, these individuals typically need to eat foods fortified with calcium or take supplements to obtain recommended amounts [28]. Calcium and Health This section focuses on six health conditions and diseases in which calcium might play a role: bone health in older adults, cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), preeclampsia, weight management, and metabolic syndrome. Bone health in older adults Bone is constantly being remodeled. Declining levels of estrogen in women during menopause and for approximately 5 years afterward lead to rates of bone resorption that are higher than rates of bone formation, resulting in a rapid decrease in bone mass [7]. Over time, postmenopausal women can develop osteoporosis, in which bone strength is compromised because of lower BMD and bone quality [1]. Age-related bone loss can also occur in men and lead to osteoporosis, but fracture risk tends to increase in older men about 5 to 10 years later than in older women [1]. Osteoporosis increases the risk of fractures, especially of the hip, vertebrae, and forearms [1,7]. FDA has approved a health claim for the use of supplements containing calcium and vitamin D to reduce the risk of osteoporosis [29].\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/lactose-intolerance\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Lactose Intolerance - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics Dietary limitation of calcium-rich foods should be done only in the context of objectively proven lactose intolerance. There is significant variability in the severity of symptoms,14 and many patients with lactose malabsorption are able to consume moderate amounts of lactose without symptoms,15 so both the diagnosis and treatment should be pursued under professional guidance.16 Effects of Lactose on Calcium Absorption Lactose intolerance has been associated with the development of osteoporosis [40] and, more recently, has been shown to be a predictor of fracture [41]. The connection between lactose intolerance and osteoporosis would appear to be due to a reduced calcium intake associated with an avoidance of milk products [41]. It is therefore appropriate to determine whether milk products cause abdominal symptoms as this may be an indicator of lactose intolerance. Another aspect is that in subjects with lactose intolerance, lactose will itself induce calcium malabsorption from about 25 to 20% [42]. This effect may be due to the osmotic effects of the lactose reducing the effective concentration of calcium within the bowel [36]. Interestingly, in normal subjects, lactose may increase calcium absorption from 22 to 36% [42]. Unfortunately, lactose was not compared to other carbohydrates so it is uncertain as to whether this effect is specific to lactose. Lactose Intolerance Lactose intolerance is defined by the occurrence of symptoms after ingestion of lactose, the main carbohydrate in milk. These symptoms may include abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, or flatulence. Lactose intolerance is usually secondary to lactose malabsorption caused by a relative deficiency of the disaccharidase lactase, which reduces the ability to digest lactose.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/three-out-of-four-indians-have-no-milk-tolerance-study/articleshow/46522488.cms\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Three out of four Indians have no milk tolerance: Study | Lucknow ...

Orthopaedic department faculty of King George's Medical University, Dr R N Srivastava added that Indians also had a very high rate of hypovitaminosis (deficiency of vitamin D) and dependence on vegetarian diet complicates the problem of weak bones further. âLow vitamin d level means no absorption of calcium, milk being the commonest source. Calcium supplementation is perhaps the only option for most of us,â he said. - milk intolerance is basically person's inability to digest milk sugars called lactose. - lactose in body is broken down into simpler sugars glusose with the help of an enzyme called lactase. - intolerance happens due to low levels of lactase in body either due to congenital reason, developmental (natural decline in body's enzymes due to aging) or secondary (like faulty eating habits and stress or anxiety) reasons. - abdominal pain, diarrhea, flatulence (passing gas), abdominal bloating, abdominal distention, and nausea are common symptoms of lactose intolerance.

The severity of the symptoms of lactose intolerance varies greatly from person to person. One reason for this variability is that people have different amounts of lactose in their diet; the more lactose in the diet, the more likely and severe the symptoms. Another reason for the variability is that people have different severities of lactase deficiency, that is, they may have a mild, moderate, or severe reduction in the amounts of lactase in their intestines. Thus, small amounts of lactose will cause major symptoms in severely lactase-deficient people but only mild or no symptoms in mildly lactase-deficient people. Finally, people may have different responses to the same amount of lactose reaching the colon. Whereas some may have mild or no symptoms, others may have moderate symptoms. The reason for this is not clear but may relate to differences in their intestinal bacteria. Lactose intolerance is rarely due to milk allergy in adults. Children with milk allergy, where it is more common, usually outgrow the allergy by adulthood. What are the long-term consequences of lactose intolerance? The important long-term health consequence of lactose intolerance is calcium deficiency which leads to osteoporosis. Less commonly, vitamin D deficiency may occur and compound the bone disease. Both of these health issues can be prevented easily by calcium and vitamin D supplements. The real problem is that many lactose-intolerant people who consciously or unconsciously avoid milk do not realize that they need supplements. What is new in lactose intolerance research?

The problem, Savaiano says, is that dairy foods can be difficult to digest, and people who don't eat these foods often enough haven't acclimated themselves to the foods. According to the National Institutes of Health, as many as 50 million Americans are lactose intolerant. Although lactose intolerance itself isn't harmful -- it may result in gas, bloating or nausea -- it does affect a person's health in the long-term because avoiding dairy foods reduces calcium intake. According to Savaiano, three-fourths of all calcium in diets in the United States come from dairy foods. Too little calcium in a diet can reduce bone growth, which can lead to osteoporosis later in life. Osteoporosis, which affects 35 million Americans, can result in weakened bones, causing fractures and injuries. Patients in the United States spend $13 billion a year on osteoporosis treatments. \\\"If you only consume dairy products once in awhile, you are more likely to have symptoms from them,\\\" Savaiano says. \\\"Also, if you consume them by themselves, as opposed to as part of a meal, they tend to be transported throughout the intestine more rapidly and are more likely to cause symptoms. \\\" Savaiano has four tips to improve digestion of milk and dairy products. \\\"These approaches can improve lactose tolerance to the point that people can consume diets that are quite rich in calcium and in milk and experience no difference in their symptoms from eating a diet without the milk,\\\" he says.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d7\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8072827/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Milk and Dairy Products: Good or Bad for Human Bone?

Lactose Intolerance Lactose may be absorbed after decomposing into glucose and galactose by lactase, which is produced in the small intestine. Lactase deficiency—called lactose intolerance (LI)—may cause cramps in the abdomen and pain, diarrhea, and bloating. LI can lead to lower consumption of dairy products [70,71]. LI is genetically conditioned and associated with single polymorphism nucleotide of the MCM6 gene in 13910CC and 22018GG [72]. Lactose intolerance is different in various countries and affects about 99% of China’s population, 20% of people in the USA, and below 10% of Scandinavia and Netherland inhabitants [73]. Milk and dairy products are the main sources of calcium in many regions around the world. It is vital to note that lactose stimulates calcium absorption in children but not in adults [5]. LI is probably not a direct factor of osteoporosis development; nevertheless, decreased consumption of dairy products due to lactase deficiency and not replacing them with other calcium-rich products may cause decreased BMD. Among Turkish emigrants in Germany, many presented LI, but it did not affect calcium intake, bone turnover markers or BMD [74].

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Dick Van Dyke, Rita Moreno and More Stars in Their 90s and Beyond: Hollywood’s Oldest Living Legends Stars like Dick Van Dyke, Clint Eastwood and Rita Moreno have been gracing our TV screens for decades — and they’re still making an impact in Hollywood during their twilight years. After Eastwood was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1950, Universal Studios employee Chuck Hill spotted him while filming at Fort Ord in California and brought him to the company. Eastwood signed with the company in 1954. He went on to make his directorial debut in 1971’s Play Mistyfor Me and has continued his career in front — and behind — the camera ever since. Eastwood, who turned 90 in 2020 and has won five Oscars including the Irving G. Thalberg Award, is still pursuing his passion and is set to release Juror No. 2 in late 2024. Thank You!

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON. The rest is plain text.\n- ≥80% of final-answer sentences include [dX] (unless abstaining).\n- Use an EM DASH \" — \" in the label line (not hyphen or en dash).\n- Be precise and faithful; no new facts; respect length budgets.\n\nInputs:\n\n- query:\n{query}\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n{retrieved_docs}\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n{per_doc_notes}\n\nTask:\n1) Follow the full OUTPUT CONTRACT exactly.\n   • <think> block with:\n       (A) VALID JSON array for EVERY doc d1…dN (order-preserving, one object per doc; if verdict==\"irrelevant\" set key_fact=\"\")\n       (B) Conflict reasoning FIRST: cluster docs, reference doc IDs, and NAME the mechanism (temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive)\n       (C) ONE label line: \"<ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\"\n       (D) Brief reasoning connecting evidence to the final answer (or abstention)\n   • ONE blank line\n   • Final answer (or exactly \"CANNOT ANSWER, INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\" if abstaining)\n   • Final sentinel line [[END-OF-ANSWER]].\n\nReminders (DO NOT PRINT):\n- Reason FIRST for the conflict: write the analysis in (B), THEN emit the label line in (C); the label must be a direct consequence of the reasoning.\n- Conflict taxonomy (strict): No conflict / Complementary information / Conflicting opinions or research outcomes / Conflict due to outdated information / Conflict due to misinformation.\n- Use only existing doc_ids in bracketed citations [dX]; no ranges like d1–d5; never cite out-of-bounds [dK].\n- Prefer high-credibility sources and order citations high→low in the evidence list.\n- If any doc is \"supports\" or \"partially supports\", DO NOT abstain.\n- Close </think> before the answer; no extra text outside the required format."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Inputs:\n\n- query:\nIs video conferencing a secure form of communication?\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.bluejeans.com/blog/secure-video-conference\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Secure Video Conferencing Platforms: How to Encrypt Web Meetings Secure Video Conferencing Platforms: How to Encrypt Web Meetings Share Categories With the increase in virtual work, many organizations are now holding online meetings often. Security is a primary concern for such meetings because online hackers devise more creative ways to get sensitive information from companies. Hackers navigate through systems and manipulate data, leading to a data breach. Fortunately, you can take several measures to secure your meetings and keep your information confidential. Here are crucial steps to encrypting web meetings. What is a secure video call? A secure video call is an encrypted setup designed to protect information from a web meeting. It keeps communication safe, and only participants can see the details and not anyone else. How to create encrypted video calls Encrypted video calls are easy to create if you have the right skills or get quality service from a highly experienced service provider such as BlueJeans. BlueJeans website offers automated encrypted calls that can keep your communication and information safe. Consider end-to-end encryption An end to end encrypted video call is a secure form of communication that allows only users to access meetings and read messages. This is a crucial factor to consider before holding web meetings. It prevents a third party from accessing meeting information, thus, keeping communication safe. Update your video conferencing software Video conferencing software performs better when you keep updating it. Updated software comes with additional and high-end features that improve the security of your online meetings. Keep doing this often for effective communication and the safety of your information. Create unbreakable passwords Online meetings have passwords that every participant needs to use to access the meeting. Create strong passwords that are hard for anyone to break and assign everyone a unique meeting ID. Once you begin the meeting, block out intruders that you've not invited, even if they are your team members. All you want is to be sure that every participant was invited to the meeting. Limit sharing Some meetings can be open to sharing, but others need to be restricted depending on the sensitivity of the information. If the information is sensitive, limit your team from sharing meeting details. Avoid inviting people who are not on the original guest list. Rather, decide the kind of information to share with them. You should also avoid sharing the meeting invitation link for security purposes.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://trueconf.com/blog/reviews-comparisons/secure-video-conferencing-7-best-apps.html\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Secure Video Conferencing: 7 Best Apps and Best Practices Secure Video Conferencing: 7 Best Apps and Best Practices Video conferencing is a powerful tool that enables real-time, face-to-face communication with colleagues around the world. With this method of interaction, a business manager from Argentina can have a virtual meeting with the heads of his factory in China, and military officials in the Pentagon can give new orders to soldiers right on the battlefield. At the same time, security is essential for video conferencing, especially when it comes to corporate communications. If the solution for online meetings is not sufficiently protected, confidential documents and users’ personal data may be exposed to intruders. Such a situation can lead to an unpleasant or even dangerous outcome, resulting in the discrediting or closure of the organization. Video conferencing security is already protected by several laws that prioritize user privacy. Recent government regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) or the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), require healthcare providers, financial institutions, and other companies to ensure the safety of all electronic data related to their customers and patients. After the innovations, most vendors have become even more responsible for the security systems of their solutions. Here are 5 more things to help with security for video conferences: Your password must consist of at least 8 characters, including a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, and must be changed regularly every three months. IT-security experts also strongly recommend using multiple forms of authentication to log in to accounts, and also warn of the danger of reusing the same login credentials. Only install software from reliable sources that you know and trust: otherwise, you may put the computer’s security at risk. If there is such an opportunity, you can even hire a specialized software development team to help solve the problems. Regularly updating the software and operating system will help protect the devices from new viruses and malware. Thus, your personal computer or laptop, tablet or smartphone will work efficiently and the likelihood of a cyber attack will decrease significantly. Use a firewall on the devices to monitor, filter, and block any unauthorized network traffic connections. Antivirus is also important to protect against potential cyber threats and their repercussions.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.digigone.com/secure-multimedia-communications\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Secure Communications | Versatile, Text, Voice, and Video - Digigone If a participant has more than one camera connected, the software gives the ability to easily select and change cameras during the conference.

Video Streaming digiChat allows the Video Teleconferencing capability to be used for the live encrypted streaming of video and audio content from manned or unmanned video cameras for broadcasting and surveillance applications. The output from these cameras is transmitted to a Virtual or Ad Hoc Host. Parties wishing to observe or broadcast the transmission use digiChat client software to connect to the appropriate Host session.

Audio Teleconferencing digiChat allows for peer-to-peer and peer-to-multi peer encrypted audio calls and conferencing. An audio teleconference is accomplished following the same path as described, above, in the Video Teleconferencing session, except that the participant’s video window and camera are not turned on. Mixed conferences are facilitated with some participants using audio and video, video only or audio only. Instant Messaging (IM) digiChat allows for encrypted texting from any participant to all the participants. The maximum characters allowed per message are 160. File Transfer digiChat allows for any file to be transferred in encrypted format to any or all of the participants on a video or audio teleconference or streaming session. To securely transfer a file, a participant clicks on a convenient “Send File” icon, is given the choice to select or deselect which conference participants will receive the file, is then given the ability to select a file to transfer from anywhere on the computer and then upload the file to the recipients.

With so many concerns when choosing the best video conferencing software solution for your team â how user-friendly it is, its versatility, its built-in features, and integrations â itâs easy to overlook one of the most important: security. This is especially true if youâre not a technical expert, which can make identifying any security issues a challenge. If this is the case, you can make your task easier by focusing on what you can identify. Firstly, is there a transparent overview of how the web conferencing platform manages security? Next, can you see the platform's certifications and which ones they have in progress? Also, does the platform offer all the security features discussed earlier in this article, such as SSO authentication, multiple data backups, self-service data erasure, and end-to-end data encryption? With these key considerations in mind, along with the top three secure platforms â Livestorm, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams â as a point of comparison, you can ensure a safe and reliable video conferencing solution for your business. Whatâs the most secure video conferencing app? Livestorm â best for small and large-scale webinars, internal meetings, live events, and product demos Google Teams â best for small teams with simple needs Microsoft Teams â best for business using Microsoft tools, like Outlook What best practices for secure video conferencing?

But what many workplaces forget is that video conferencing security is just as essential as being secure with conference calls, emails or any other form of remote communication. As pivotal as it is to secure your video chats, actually enforcing security is rarely easy. Plenty of businesses are tempted to simply layer security measures like firewalls or additional passwords onto web tools after the fact. However, in practice, these are fairly simple obstacles for hackers to jump over, and once they’re breached, organizations are left unprotected against illicit access to private business communications and even user data. Even for small businesses, attacks like this can be devastating, costing both immediate revenue loss and a severe drop in reputation. The crux of a secure video conferencing service isn’t simply add-ons or layered tools. The fact is, without protection built directly into the service, there won’t be any real security in conference calls you make over the web. But what does that built-in security look like? Here, we’ll explain exactly that by walking through what technology it takes to truly achieve video conferencing security. For further protection, we’ll also go through several key video conferencing security best practices. Passwords The most direct way a hacker can gain unauthorized access to video calls is simply by logging in. If users’ passwords are overly simplistic or common, it will only be a matter of time before a cyberattacker simply guesses the correct credentials. This is why any secure video conferencing platform must require users to create sufficiently long and unique passwords — especially ones with different letter cases, numbers and special characters. As any IT manager can tell you, there will always be employees who use overly simple or obvious passwords when setting up an account. To combat this, a secure conference calling service must outright reject such passwords as insufficient and require users to create longer ones. However, requiring long, complex passwords will not inherently create a secure web conferencing environment. After all, password databases are frequently hacked and leaked over the dark web, granting access to hackers just as easily.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d6\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.zoho.com/meeting/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Online Meeting Software & Platform - Zoho Meeting Share your screen Record and share meetings Record, replay, and share your web meeting recordings with members who could not make it to your meeting.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array;

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array;

Apart from the Kolkata Metro (which has its own zone under Indian Railways),[21] these rapid transit metro lines are not operated by Indian Railways, but a separate set of local authorities. In addition to their metro systems, the cities of Chennai and Hyderabad have mass transit systems operated by the Indian Railways, known as the Chennai MRTS and the Hyderabad MMTS, respectively. The first rapid transit system in India is the Kolkata Metro, which started operations in 1984. Kolkata Metro also currently has the only underwater metro line in the country.

The Union Government would invest an estimated ₹5 lakh crore (US$58 billion).[27][28] In a new draft policy unveiled in March 2017, the Central Government stated that it wanted state governments to consider metro rail as the \\\"last option\\\" and implement it only after considering all other possible mass rapid transit systems.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2025-04-03\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://factodata.com/indian-cities-with-metro-network/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Indian Cities with Metro network - FactoData There are 17 Indian cities metro train system as on October 2024, with Delhi metro as the leader among them.

Ridership Details of the Metro Network in India As of January 2024, India's metro ridership is witnessing a steep rise as daily ridership across metro systems in the country has already crossed the one crore mark. The ridership is expected to exceed 1.25 crore in a year or two. Here are some key highlights of India's metro rail system: Daily ridership across all metro rail systems has surpassed one crore. Over three-fourths of India's metro rail network has been conceptualised, constructed, and operationalised in less than a decade. The Delhi Metro is the largest, with an annual ridership of over 100 crores. Many commuters still prefer other modes of transport for short trips. However, the metro in India is becoming the preferred mode of commuting, especially for women and the young population. In Sum - Metro Maps & Network in India Regarding the metro network in India, all the metropolitan cities have been bestowed with a well-connected metro rail facility, which will only escalate and bring to even more cities across the country. The roadmap of various State Governments shows that each city will develop the existing projects to their maximum capabilities and introduce world-class metro facilities to tier 2 and tier 3 cities. This will only help further connect many urban and rural neighbourhoods and expand the metro network in India.

Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON. The rest is plain text.\n- ≥80% of final-answer sentences include [dX] (unless abstaining).\n- Use an EM DASH \" — \" in the label line (not hyphen or en dash).\n- Be precise and faithful; no new facts; respect length budgets.\n\nInputs:\n\n- query:\n{query}\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n{retrieved_docs}\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n{per_doc_notes}\n\nTask:\n1) Follow the full OUTPUT CONTRACT exactly.\n   • <think> block with:\n       (A) VALID JSON array for EVERY doc d1…dN (order-preserving, one object per doc; if verdict==\"irrelevant\" set key_fact=\"\")\n       (B) Conflict reasoning FIRST: cluster docs, reference doc IDs, and NAME the mechanism (temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive)\n       (C) ONE label line: \"<ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\"\n       (D) Brief reasoning connecting evidence to the final answer (or abstention)\n   • ONE blank line\n   • Final answer (or exactly \"CANNOT ANSWER, INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\" if abstaining)\n   • Final sentinel line [[END-OF-ANSWER]].\n\nReminders (DO NOT PRINT):\n- Reason FIRST for the conflict: write the analysis in (B), THEN emit the label line in (C); the label must be a direct consequence of the reasoning.\n- Conflict taxonomy (strict): No conflict / Complementary information / Conflicting opinions or research outcomes / Conflict due to outdated information / Conflict due to misinformation.\n- Use only existing doc_ids in bracketed citations [dX]; no ranges like d1–d5; never cite out-of-bounds [dK].\n- Prefer high-credibility sources and order citations high→low in the evidence list.\n- If any doc is \"supports\" or \"partially supports\", DO NOT abstain.\n- Close </think> before the answer; no extra text outside the required format."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Inputs:\n\n- query:\nwhen was the multiculturalism policy passed\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Multiculturalism_Act\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Canadian Multiculturalism Act - Wikipedia The Canadian Multiculturalism Act is a law of Canada, passed in 1988, that aims to preserve and enhance cultural diversity, i.e. multiculturalism, in Canada ... Details WHEREAS the Constitution of Canada provides that every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and benefit of the law without discrimination and that everyone has the freedom of conscience, religion, thought, belief, opinion, expression, peaceful assembly and association and guarantees those rights and freedoms equally to male and female persons... The multiculturalism policy allows citizens to practice their religions and keep their identities without the fear of official persecution. It is believed by some that without this fear, Canadians are more willing to accept different cultures. The policy, therefore, emphasizes a mutual respect between ethnicities and also acceptance of one's personal beliefs.[4] This policy guarantees equality before the law and for pursuing opportunities whether personal, career, or in any other field.[4] This means anyone of any race or ethnic origin is capable of pursuing his or her interests without persecution. Canadian law, as a result, reflects many of these rights and belief as they guaranteed to all men and women.[4] All of these rights are guaranteed in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms which is part of the Canadian Constitution.[4] All citizens are equal and have the freedom to preserve, enhance and share their cultural heritage. Multiculturalism promotes the full and equitable participation of individuals and communities of all origins in all aspects of Canadian society. The act binds the federal government and its institutions to encourage, facilitate, assist and undertake several high-minded goals. The Minister may also enter into agreements with provincial and foreign governments to promote these goals. Other ministers may enter into agreements with the provinces. The \\\"Canadian multiculturalism advisory committee\\\" is established in Section 7, and the Minister is charged with the annual composition of a report on the operation of the act.

The Act enshrined multicultural policy in law, declaring the government would “recognize and promote the understanding that multiculturalism is a fundamental characteristic of the Canadian heritage and identity” and “promote the full and equitable participation of individuals and communities of all origins in the continuing evolution and shaping of all aspects of Canadian society and assist them in the elimination of any barrier to that participation.” Canada was the first country in the world to pass a national multiculturalism law. At the time, critics of the new law said that it ignored many of the Standing Committee’s recommendations, including re-establishing a Ministry of Multiculturalism. For example, writing in the Globe & Mail, columnist Jeffrey Simpson said, “the act creates no new ministry, offers no additional funds for multiculturalism (however defined) and guarantees no rights no otherwise already protected,” adding “it's hard to see how any member of a multicultural group will benefit from this bill.” Effects and Legacy The Act affirmed Canada’s status as a multicultural nation, presenting the notion of multiculturalism as a force for positive change. It encouraged all government departments to take responsibility for the implementation and support of multicultural policies, specifically by encouraging diverse involvement in Canada’s major institutions. The Act also implemented a series of regular reports on the efficacy and reach of Canada’s multicultural policy, which helped to strengthen it. It laid the groundwork for the eventual creation of the Department of Multiculturalism and Citizenship, which worked more specifically to address barriers to equal opportunity and integration.

Canadian Multiculturalism Act, 1988 Summary The Canadian Multiculturalism Act of 1988 provided a legislative framework to the existing policy of multiculturalism and expanded its focus. Revisions to the policy were deemed necessary to better reflect Canada’s increasingly diverse racial and ethnic composition. The act sought to protect the cultural heritage of all Canadians, reduce discrimination, and encourage the implementation of multicultural programs and initiatives within institutions and organizations. Canada was the first country to pass a national multiculturalism law. The Canadian Multiculturalism Act of 1988 provided a legislative framework for the official policy of multiculturalism adopted by the government in 1971. The act sought to protect the cultural heritage of Canadians, reduce discrimination and encourage the implementation of multicultural programs and activities within institutions and organizations.[1] The act grew out of a 1987 report issued by the parliamentary standing committee on multiculturalism which stated the existing policy of multiculturalism no longer adequately met the needs of Canada’s multicultural society. The original policy of multiculturalism focused on cultural preservation, primarily reflecting the interests of European-born immigrants. However, as the centre of immigration gradually shifted away from Europe with increasing numbers of immigrants from Asia, Africa and the Middle East, new concerns and priorities emerged. In addition to cultural and linguistic retention, newcomers expressed concerns about employment, housing, education and discrimination.[2] To reflect the changing reality of Canada’s racial and ethnic diversity, a new multiculturalism policy came into effect in July of 1988. The Canadian Multiculturalism Act acknowledged multiculturalism as a fundamental characteristic of Canadian society with an integral role in shaping Canada’s future. The measures emphasized the right of all individuals to preserve and share their cultural heritage while retaining their right to full and equitable participation in Canadian society. The act sought to remove any barriers preventing full participation in society and promised to assist individuals in eliminating and overcoming discrimination. Intercultural exchange and interaction was encouraged in an effort to foster a greater appreciation and awareness of Canada’s cultural diversity.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2025-01-01\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/statements/2021/10/08/statement-prime-minister-50th-anniversary-canadas-multiculturalism\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Statement by the Prime Minister on the 50th anniversary of Canada's ...

Main Content The Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on the 50th anniversary of Canada’s multiculturalism policy: “On this day in 1971, Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau announced multiculturalism as an official government policy – the first of its kind in the world – to recognize the contribution of cultural diversity and multicultural citizenship to the Canadian social fabric. “The diversity of Canadians is a fundamental characteristic of our heritage and identity. For generations, newcomers from all over the world, of all backgrounds, ethnicities, faiths, cultures, and languages, have been coming to Canada with the hopes of making it their home. Today, in addition to First Nations, Métis, and Inuit peoples, people from more than 250 ethnic groups call Canada home and celebrate their cultural heritage with pride – they are at the heart of our success as a vibrant, prosperous, and progressive country. “Canada’s multiculturalism policy was implemented based on the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism. These recommendations were made upon the urging of diverse ethnocultural groups throughout Canada, a reminder of the lengthy and ongoing struggle for equality in this country. The policy promotes respect for cultural diversity, acknowledges the freedom of all members of Canadian society to preserve, enhance, and share their own cultural heritage, and considers their cultural contributions throughout the country as essential to Canada. The policy received constitutional sanction in 1982, with an explicit recognition that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms should be interpreted in a manner consistent with the multicultural heritage of Canadians. Multiculturalism was then further enshrined into law in 1988 through the passing of the Canadian Multiculturalism Act,which was adopted unanimously by Parliament.

Canadian Multiculturalism Policy, 1971 Summary In a statement to the House of Commons on 8 October 1971, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau announced multiculturalism within a bilingual framework as an official government policy. Multiculturalism was intended to preserve the cultural freedom of individuals and provide recognition of the cultural contributions of diverse ethnic groups to Canadian society. The government committed to support multiculturalism by assisting cultural groups in their development, assisting individuals in overcoming discriminatory barriers, encouraging intercultural exchange and assisting immigrants in learning French or English. In a statement to the House of Commons on 8 October 1971, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau announced multiculturalism as an official government policy. Multiculturalism was intended to preserve the cultural freedom of all individuals and provide recognition of the cultural contributions of diverse ethnic groups to Canadian society. The policy of multiculturalism was implemented based on the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism. The commission was appointed in 1963 to examine the existing state of bilingualism and biculturalism in Canada and to work towards developing an equal partnership between the British and French elements within the country. Commissioners were additionally instructed to consider the cultural contributions of other ethnic groups, but many cultural groups throughout Canada expressed concern that the latter part of the mandate was being ignored.[1] The commission addressed these concerns in their fourth and final report, recommending that minority groups be given greater recognition and support in preserving their cultures.[2] The recommendations of the commission were adapted to become the government’s official policy of multiculturalism. In his speech to the House of Commons, Trudeau stated that no singular culture could define Canada and that the government accepted “the contention of other cultural communities that they, too, are essential elements in Canada.” A policy of multiculturalism was implemented to promote respect for cultural diversity and grant ethnic groups the right to preserve and develop their own cultures within Canadian society.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2025-01-01\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d7\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://library.fiveable.me/history-canada-after-1867/unit-13/development-multiculturalism-official-policy/study-guide/TAE3hVeB9MKP7WZw\",\n    \"snippet\": \"13.1 The Development of Multiculturalism as Official Policy - Fiveable Canada's multiculturalism policy emerged in the 1970s, shaping the nation's identity.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

No, we’re not talking about a sitcom. We’re talking about the current trending diet of intermittent fasting. But before you dismiss it as just a fad, Jeffrey Hooper, MD, says for some people intermittent fasting has real benefits that may go beyond weight loss. “It’s not new,” says Dr. Hooper, medical director for the MultiCare Center for Weight Loss & Wellness. “Like so many things in weight loss, the pendulum swings, and intermittent fasting is getting popular again.” And because it’s been around for a while, intermittent fasting “actually has science behind it,” he adds. In late December, the New England Journal of Medicine published an article reviewing previous intermittent fasting studies, giving the method another big publicity boost. The review highlighted findings that, along with promoting weight loss, intermittent fasting decreases insulin resistance and the chances of developing diabetes, reduces risk for some cancers and forms of dementia and increases cardiovascular health and stress resistance. Studies in rats showed that intermittent fasting greatly increased their lifespans and slowed the aging process. “A lot of these things are connected to weight loss, but others are less related,” Dr. Hooper says. “There’s benefit from doing this that goes beyond just the weight loss effect.” Researchers know it works, but not necessarily how, he says. The New England Journal review theorizes that the key is something called “metabolic switching.” The body always needs energy, and when you’ve eaten, that energy comes from the glucose in your food. But when you haven’t eaten for a few hours, your body turns to glucose stored in your liver. When you still don’t eat, your body runs out of its stored glucose, then turns to burning ketones from your fat cells. This process is also the basis for the ketogenic diet, Dr. Hooper says. The difference between intermittent fasting and a strict keto diet is that you don’t have to restrict any foods.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.dzne.de/en/news/press-releases/press/intermittent-fasting-not-an-anti-aging-remedy-for-mice/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Intermittent fasting: not an anti-aging remedy for mice - DZNE Intermittent fasting: not an anti-aging remedy for mice Bonn/Munich (Germany), July, 31st, 2017. Fasting affects the body in a number of ways. Abundant evidence is available to show that it can even extend the lifespan of animals. But does fasting slow down the aging process? At least in mice, anti-aging effects are limited. This is the conclusion of a joint study by the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) and the Helmholtz Zentrum München. However, the regular alternation of periods of food intake and fasting – a dietary regimen called “intermittent fasting” – slowed down the development of life-limiting cancers. As a result, the animals lived longer than mice with free access to food. There is no doubt that fasting affects the body and the mind. While little research has been done into the long-term effects on humans, many studies have examined the consequences of life-long fasting in animals. These experiments have shown that mice placed on a strict diet live longer than controls with free access to food. Average lifespan is extended by around 15 percent in mice. In human terms, this would mean around 12 additional years of life. But do these animals age more slowly? “Until now, this was the prevailing view within the scientific community. It is often based on the observation that fasting animals live longer than controls without restrictions in feeding. However, measuring only lifespan does not provide conclusive evidence regarding possible effects on aging. An extension in lifespan can be the result of an isolated effect on specific life-limiting diseases,” says Dr. Dan Ehninger, who leads a research group at the DZNE’s site in Bonn. “We therefore looked comprehensively at a large range of features associated with aging. Overall, we found only limited evidence for a retardation of aging as a consequence of fasting.”\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4755412/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Dietary restriction with and without caloric restriction for healthy aging Caloric restriction and fasting share similar but often distinct effects on a number of biomarkers (e.g. reduced glucose, and insulin levels) suggesting that partially overlapping mechanisms are involved 19. Both intermittent and periodic fasting can increase lifespan, even when there is little or no overall decrease in calorie intake 34, 50. Macronutrient restriction In addition to periodic or intermittent fasting-based strategies as alternatives to caloric restriction, the restriction of specific macronutrients (or macronutrient restriction) without the restriction of calories is among the most promising interventions that have emerged to promote healthy aging in humans. Among the different types of macronutrient restriction, reduced intake of proteins and amino acids is the most effective pro-longevity intervention 35, 36. Simply reducing protein intake can deliver an equally potent impact on lifespan as dietary restriction in multiple model organisms 35. A recent analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) showed that low protein intake was associated with reduced overall mortality for those under 65 years of age 37. Also, a high-carbohydrate, low-protein diet resulted in longer lifespan and improved cardiometabolic health, despite increased food intake and body fat 38, 39. Furthermore, the restriction of a single essential amino acid in a normal diet increased lifespan and stress resistance 40– 44. In flies, adding back essential amino acids to the caloric restriction diet decreased lifespan to that of the normally fed group 36.

Researchers in Germany have found that three popular anti-aging strategies fail to actually slow the hands of time. During their review, a team from the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) developed a new way to measure aging. Instead of simply looking at lifespan, the team focused on the age-related changes that take place in a wide range of bodily functions over time. Using this measure, they examined the effectiveness of intermittent fasting and two anti-aging treatments which target cell metabolism and growth hormones, respectively. Results show that each longevity strategy was largely ineffective when it comes to slowing the aging process. “There is no internal clock of aging that you can regulate with a simple switch – at least not in the form of the treatments studied here,” says Dr. Dan Ehninger of the DZNE, the initiator of the study, in a media release. “We chose three regulators for our interventions that many experts believe slow down aging,” explains Prof. Dr. Martin Hrabě de Angelis, head of the Institute of Experimental Genetics and director of the German Mouse Clinic at Helmholtz Munich.

Meanwhile, the second treatment targets a central node of cell metabolism (mTOR). The anti-aging drug rapamycin is one of the prominent compounds targeting mTOR. Finally, the study examined the interference in the release of growth hormones. Although there are treatments for humans which target this anti-aging pathway, their effectiveness is still unclear.

Scientists believe that the eating period in intermittent fasting is equally important as the fasting period. During these two periods, cells are affected positively and activated towards rejuvenation and prevention of aging-related diseases. During IF your body starts using the stored fat and energy thus contributing to weight loss. Practiced along with daily exercise, IF may help to lose weight faster. IF contributes to DNA repair by breaking down free radicals causing oxidative stress. During the fasting period brain activity increases, memory and sleep quality improve. This way, IF hinders neurodegenerative disorders while aging. Yet, intermittent fasting may not be a suitable reverse aging diet plan for everyone. Dietitians advise not to practice IF to the people falling into these groups Pregnant and breastfeeding women People younger than 18-year-olds People with confirmed health disorders such as diabetes People with a previous history of eating disorders Hence, intermittent fasting is a natural method for reverse aging and is one of the effective reverse aging habitspracticed by thousands of people with documented health benefits for slow aging. 2.

When food wasn’t available, their metabolisms would also slow down, keeping the weight on as long as it could (6). With middle age, your metabolism slows down due to hormonal changes, so simply cutting calories rarely will result in weight loss. Your metabolism slows down even further because it thinks it’s in a famine. And it’s not just about the quantity of the food you’re eating but the quality. While younger premenopausal women have to adapt their fasting due to their cycling schedule, you’ll have the advantage of consistency. Menopausal women can stick with their fasting schedule and should be able to last longer without worry. Intermittent fasting isn’t about not eating but about eating less often. You don’t have to worry about how many calories you’re eating during your feeding window when you’re eating quality foods. Your body is designed to fast intermittently, so start taking advantage of your ancestor’s adaptation to lose the stubborn weight. 🔔 Best Intermittent Fasting For Women Over 50 The 16/8 method of intermittent fasting is the simplest to do and one of the most effective long-term for getting results. This fasting schedule allows you to have dinner at night and then lunch the next day. Skipping breakfast is the easiest meal to drop since most are busy in the mornings. Women in their 50s can practice intermittent fasting more often and for longer periods than younger women since they do not have to worry about adjusting it for their monthly cycle. In addition, you can use intermittent fasting daily if your goal is to lose weight and its additional health benefits. Also, intermittent fasting helps slow the aging process by autophagy, which kills off destructive aging cells in the body (7).

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON. The rest is plain text.\n- ≥80% of final-answer sentences include [dX] (unless abstaining).\n- Use an EM DASH \" — \" in the label line (not hyphen or en dash).\n- Be precise and faithful; no new facts; respect length budgets.\n\nInputs:\n\n- query:\n{query}\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n{retrieved_docs}\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n{per_doc_notes}\n\nTask:\n1) Follow the full OUTPUT CONTRACT exactly.\n   • <think> block with:\n       (A) VALID JSON array for EVERY doc d1…dN (order-preserving, one object per doc; if verdict==\"irrelevant\" set key_fact=\"\")\n       (B) Conflict reasoning FIRST: cluster docs, reference doc IDs, and NAME the mechanism (temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive)\n       (C) ONE label line: \"<ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\"\n       (D) Brief reasoning connecting evidence to the final answer (or abstention)\n   • ONE blank line\n   • Final answer (or exactly \"CANNOT ANSWER, INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\" if abstaining)\n   • Final sentinel line [[END-OF-ANSWER]].\n\nReminders (DO NOT PRINT):\n- Reason FIRST for the conflict: write the analysis in (B), THEN emit the label line in (C); the label must be a direct consequence of the reasoning.\n- Conflict taxonomy (strict): No conflict / Complementary information / Conflicting opinions or research outcomes / Conflict due to outdated information / Conflict due to misinformation.\n- Use only existing doc_ids in bracketed citations [dX]; no ranges like d1–d5; never cite out-of-bounds [dK].\n- Prefer high-credibility sources and order citations high→low in the evidence list.\n- If any doc is \"supports\" or \"partially supports\", DO NOT abstain.\n- Close </think> before the answer; no extra text outside the required format."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Inputs:\n\n- query:\nHow many undergraduate students enrolled in Reed College in the most recent fall semester?\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.reed.edu/ir/enrollment_hist.html\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Historical Enrollment (fall census headcount) - Institutional Research New Undergraduate Students (fall) · Total new, 422 ; Continuing Undergraduate Students (fall) · Total continuing, 998 ; Special Programs (fall) · Total special, 57 ...

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

In this way, the beads have been knocking for ... The abacus, a unique counting tool invented by ancient Chinese people, has faded out in most areas of China, as calculators and computers are widely used in modern times. But in the long history until only twenty years ago, the abacus has long been an important calculation tool for every household, not to mention accountants and dealers. The abacus is a rectangular wooden frame. Inside the frame, there are usually at least seven vertical rods and a horizontal beam. On each rod there are two rounded beads in the upper deck (each represents five) and five beads at the bottom (each represents one). Each rod represents a different numerical digit. After setting the digit, an operator can move the beads up or down towards the beam to do the calculating. Because of this, abacus computations are also called bead computations. To use the abacus well, one must recite a concise formula by which the calculations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division can all be simplified into the acts of moving the beads. It is a joy to watch a skilled hand use an abacusâBeads knock, fingers flutter, and after a few seconds, the result comes out. In the past, in addition to the ability to write elegant brush pen characters, another required skill for businessmen was to use an abacus skillfully. Whenever there was a calculation, there was an abacus. The earliest known written documentation of the Chinese abacus dates to the 2nd century BC (Chinese Han Dynasty).

The file is next to the four beads, and pressing the \\\"clearing\\\" button puts the upper bead in the upper position, and the lower bead in the lower position. The abacus is still manufactured in Japan, despite the proliferation, practicality, and affordability of pocket electronic calculators. The use of the soroban is still taught in Japanese primary schools as part of mathematics, primarily as an aid to faster mental calculation. Using visual imagery, one can complete a calculation as quickly as with a physical instrument.[34] Korea The Chinese abacus migrated from China to Korea around 1400 AD.[18][35][36] Koreans call it jupan (주판), supan (수판) or jusan (주산).[37] The four-beads abacus (1:4) was introduced during the Goryeo Dynasty. The 5:1 abacus was introduced to Korea from China during the Ming Dynasty. Native America Some sources mention the use of an abacus called a nepohualtzintzin in ancient Aztec culture.[38] This Mesoamerican abacus used a 5-digit base-20 system.[39] The word Nepōhualtzintzin Nahuatl pronunciation:[nepoːwaɬˈt͡sint͡sin] comes from Nahuatl, formed by the roots; Ne – personal -; pōhual or pōhualliNahuatl pronunciation:[ˈpoːwalːi] – the account -; and tzintzinNahuatl pronunciation:[ˈt͡sint͡sin] – small similar elements.

So, how can we be expected to use a 66 year old computer? But what if we tell you that you as well as the entire world still use the first calculator created. Abacus, an instrument to calculate or count by using sliding counters and rod is indeed the world's first calculator. Abacus was in use in Europe, China, Russia. The old version of the Abacus was a shallow tray consist of sand, and numbers could be erased easily when needed, but the modern abacus is made of wood or plastic. It is a rectangular box consist of nine vertical rods strung with beads. A horizontal crossbar that is perpendicular to the vertical rods divides them into unequal parts. The beads above the horizontal crossbar are called Heaven beads, and the beads down the bar called earth beads. Though the Abacus originated in Babylon, it had traveled a long way from the Middle East to Japan and China. When it traveled from one country to another it transited also. In China, it is called as Suanpan. In Suanpan it has \\\\(\\\\frac{2}{5}\\\\) decks. The famous Japanese mathematician Seki Kawa replaced \\\\(\\\\frac{2}{5}\\\\) decks with \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\) decks and called it Soroban. The modern-day abacus which we use today is the Soraban type of abacus. Downloadable PDF Here are some additional points that talk about a brief history of the Abacus.

Between 2700bc to 2300 bc, Sumerian used the first abacus to count. It is the belief that Old Babylonian scholars have used this abacus to do addition and subtraction. Old Babylonian scholars such as Curricio believe that the old Babylonian used their sexagesimal number system in Abacus to calculate.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/320954.320962\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Origin and Development of the Chinese Abacus - ACM Digital Library considered as the latest ancient time in the days of Hsü Y'ao.

Although, in the beginning, it was a smooth surface like a table, on which pebbles or stones were moved to conduct calculations. Later on, it was manufactured as metal frames, one in which metallic beads were placed. The Roman hand abacus followed the roman number system. Therefore, the vertical lines on the counting device represented ones, fives, tens, etc. It was so widely popular that most European markets used this counting device to do transactions. 2. When was the Abacus Invented? The origins of the abacus go as far back as Roman civilization. In fact, even before the Roman civilization, people used abacus. Therefore, it’s challenging to trace who was the first person to use an abacus, or the exact date when invented. On top of that, it wasn't a single person who invented the abacus one day. Contrastingly, it went through several changes and developments over time to become the modern abacus we use today. The modern abacus bears an uncanny resemblance to the Chinese counting frame, suanpan. If you want to attribute a particular date for the invention of the abacus, we can go with the invention of suapan, which is 190 CE in ancient China. In addition to that, the abacus for the visually impaired community is another landmark transformation in the history of the abacus. Tim Cranmer first invented it in 1960. However, it resembles soroban, the Japanese abacus. Therefore, it wasn't discovered in 1960. To summarize, there is no single invention year for abacus. And it's because this counting frame goes way back in time, and it's almost next to impossible to know when it was first invented. Watch this video to know further about the invention of abacus. 3. The Modern Abacus At present People use two types of abacus. The first type, the modern suanpan, also known as soroban: it has more than 7 rods, 1 beam, and 2 decks.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2022-02-10\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d6\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.coolaboo.com/world-history/ancient-china/ancient-china-abacus/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Ancient China Abacus Facts for Kids (All You Need to Know!)

Although credit is given to the ancient Chinese for the version of abacus that they use, there is evidence that something like the abacus was used in the ancient Sumerian culture in Mesopotamia where they used pebbles or rocks for their calculations. Other versions that have occurred were called calculating chips. These were combinations of sticks and were difficult to use. Some scholars give credit for the invention of the abacus to the ancient Romans in 100 CE. Who used the Chinese abacus? Since male children were originally the only ones to receive an education in ancient China, use of the abacus was part of their schooling. The abacus was mainly used by merchants, but many scholars used them as well as those that studied astronomy. Just about anywhere there was a need for mathematic calculations, you would see an abacus. Using a Chinese abacus Learning to use a Chinese abacus requires practice. The two strung beads represent five each and the five strung beads represent one each. The rod has a decimal value: the first are ones, the second is tens, the third is hundreds, etc. The first step is to make sure that all beads are away from the central division area. Any bead that is in the central area is “activated,” which means it has value (like putting a number in your calculator). All beads away from the central area aren’t activated and are ready to use. If you want to start with a number, let’s say 7, you just move one of the two beads on the string over to touch the divider, then move two of the ones on the “ones string” over to touch the divider. This totals to “7.” To do any other calculations you need to also use mental calculations. Abacus around the world The creation of the abacus expanded to cultures all around the world. Each culture or country developed its own version of the abacus and called it a different name. The variations depend upon the country, but they could be found everywhere from the different Asian countries, throughout what is now Russia, and then into the Middle East and Europe.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d7\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.apalconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Chinese-Abacus-Introduction.pdf\",\n    \"snippet\": \"[PDF] Chinese Abacus (算盤 Suànpán) The Chinese abacus, called Suanpan (simplified Chinese: 算盘; traditional Chinese: 算盤; pinyin: suànpán) in.

SUAN-PAN The abacus, called Suan-Pan in Chinese, as it appears today, was first chronicled circa 1200 C.E. in China. The device was made of wood with metal re-inforcements. On each rod, the classic Chinese abacus has 2 beads on the upper deck and 5 on the lower deck; such an abacus is also referred to as a 2/5 abacus. The 2/5 style survived unchanged until circa 1850 at which time the 1/5 (one bead on the top deck and five beads on the bottom deck) abacus appeared. SOROBAN Circa 1600 C.E., use and evolution of the Chinese 1/5 abacus was begun by the Japanese via Korea. In Japanese, the abacus is called Soroban. The 1/4 abacus, a style preferred and still manufactured in Japan today, appeared circa 1930. The 1/5 models are rare today and 2/5 models are rare outside of China (excepting Chinese communities in North America and elsewhere). SCHOTY The Russian abacus is called a schoty (pronounced \\\"SHAW-tee\\\"). It was invented in the 17th century and is still in use today. The design of the schoty is based on a pair of human hands (each row has ten beads, corresponding to ten fingers). The abacus is operated by sliding the beads right-to-left. If you hold out both hands in front of you, palms facing out, you will see that your two thumbs are beside each other and two sets of 4 fingers spread out from there. Similarily, on the schoty, each row has two sets of 4 beads of the same colour on the outside, representing the two sets of 4 fingers and the two inner-most beads of the same colour representing the two thumbs. The \\\"home\\\" position for the beads is on the right hand side.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d9\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://classroom.synonym.com/chinese-invention-abacus-8876.html\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Chinese Invention of the Abacus - Classroom | Synonym According to Chinese history, the abacus as we know it was invented sometime during the Ming Dynasty by mathematician Cheng Dawei. Chinese Invention of the Abacus ROBERT MORELLO The abacus is a calculator in simple, mechanical form. It consists of a series of rods with beads attached that can be slid from one side to the other. With ten beads on each row, the abacus allows its user to tally items and calculate figures into the many thousands. The origin of the abacus is a source of great debate. Explore this article 1China According to Chinese history, the abacus as we know it was invented sometime during the Ming Dynasty by mathematician Cheng Dawei. The Ming Dynasty lasted from 1388 to 1644 and was a period of cultural exchange and economic prosperity, at least in part. The Chinese consider the abacus to be among the great inventions of ancient China and have even created an annual day of celebration around it. The Chinese abacus is used to add, subtract, divide, multiply and find square and cubic roots. 2Current Use The abacus remains a teaching tool in China and elsewhere in Asia. It is provided to school children as a method of simple calculation. Blind students in particular find the abacus to be a useful and more easily managed way to perform mathematics. Merchants and vendors in many locations throughout Asia also use the abacus to perform day-to-day sales and purchase calculations quickly and efficiently. Its cheap construction from everyday materials and manual operation make it ideal for rural areas where batteries and electronics may not be readily available. 3Other Possibilities The abacus may not have originated in China at all. Other possible inventors include the Mesopotamians, the Akkadian tribe that occupied the same territory and predated the Mesopotamians, and the Egyptians who were all known to have used abaci. The difference between these ancient abaci and the Chinese version is in the construction of the device. The Chinese abacus is constructed of wood and beads on wire. The early form of the abacus seen in these other ancient civilizations is also referred to as a counting board. It was made of stone and sand, and used carvings to tally rather than moveable stone or wooden beads.

Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain;

then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

The ultimate recent literature experimental results to be considered within the framework of this contribution is the investigation by neutron diffraction of the crystallization-melting phase transition of mercury embedded in nano-porous Vycor glass with pores’ size of about 7.0 nm (42). The intensity I(110)(T) of the (110) diffraction Bragg peak was followed versus temperature varying from 293.5°K down to ~ 20°K. At room temperature no diffraction Bragg peaks were observed. During the cooling phase, a solidification started only at 205 K resulting in the appearance of (110) Bragg peak. The intensity of the peak was increasing with temperature lowering indicating the growth of the crystalline phase concentration. At T < 100 K the saturation of the (110) intensity was observed. The lower temperature diffraction patterns coincided with the bulk mercury. The measurements in the heating regime have revealed significantly large hysteresis of the I(T) dependency. In comparison to all above experimental results on nano-Hg embedded in several porous host matrices, albeit it is reduced noticeably, the melting-crystallization temperature of the considered Hg nano-particles is far below room temperature and does not agree with our current observations and those of Magnussen et al., Deutsch et al.8.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.angelo.edu/faculty/kboudrea/periodic/physical_states.htm\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Physical States — Melting Points, Boiling Points, and Densities In the periodic table above, black squares indicate elements which are solids at room temperature (about 22ºC)*, those in blue squares are liquids at room temperature, and those in red squares are gases at room temperature.

Solids In the solid state, the individual particles of a substance are in fixed positions with respect to each other because there is not enough thermal energy to overcome the intermolecular interactions between the particles. As a result, solids have a definite shape and volume. Most solids are hard, but some (like waxes) are relatively soft. Many solids composed of ions can also be quite brittle.

It can exist as a liquid at room temperature or as a solid crystal salt. The liquid metal form gives off invisible, odorless, toxic vapors. Commonly, metallic mercury can be found in thermometers, barometers, electrical switches, thermostats and in dental fillings. Organic mercury is the most poisonous form. It is used as a fungicide and preservative for seeds, wood products, and paper products. In homes, organic mercury can be found in latex paints, and metallic mercury is sometimes used in religious rituals. People can be exposed by breathing mercury vapors. This type of exposure can happen in the workplace or in homes where mercury is spilled. People can be exposed to mercury by eating fish or shellfish caught in contaminated waters. Some dental fillings contain mercury and blood levels may be elevated for a short time after teeth are filled. Mercury can enter the body when contaminated water is used for drinking or for preparing food. If a water supply is contaminated, people can absorb mercury as they bathe or use the water for other purposes. People who work with exterior latex-paints containing mercury can absorb mercury through their skin or by breathing in unsafe air in unventilated areas. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources regulates the amount of mercury that can be released by industries. No standards exist for the amount of mercury allowed in the air of homes. We use a formula to convert workplace limits to suggested home limits. Based on the formula, we recommend levels of mercury vapor be no higher than 2 ppb. The state and federal drinking water standards are both set at 2 parts per billion (ppb) of mercury. We suggest you stop drinking water containing more than 2 ppb of mercury. If levels of mercury are very high in your water, you may need to avoid washing, bathing, or using the water for other purposes.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d5\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.envirotech-online.com/news/health-and-safety/10/breaking-news/can-mercury-change-forms/57486\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Can Mercury Change Forms? Envirotech Online Can Mercury Change Forms? Although mercury might be familiar to most of us as the silver liquid inside old-fashioned thermometers and barometers, it may surprise you to learn that it has the ability to change forms from one state to another. In fact, it’s so capable at changing states that if left at normal temperatures and pressures in an unsealed container, it will over time evaporate into a gas at will. It can even change into a solid – though this only happens at extremely low temperatures (-38.8°C). Besides changing from a liquid to a gas or a solid (and vice versa), mercury can also be converted from one form into another. Elemental mercury refers to that referred to above which is used in thermometers, dental fillings, light bulbs and other consumer products. However, if it comes into contact with carbon, it will transform into an organic mercury compound such as methylmercury; if it combines with elements other than carbon (such as oxygen, chlorine or sulphur), it will produce inorganic mercury. Changing states At room temperature, mercury exists in liquid form. However, it can slowly lose its liquid properties and transform into a gas even without significant temperature or pressure changes. It will boil at 356.7°C (changing into a gas) and freeze at -38.8°C (changing into a solid), which are both currently the lowest temperatures of any known stable metal. However, preliminary research into the physical properties of copernicium and flerovium indicates that they may have lower boiling points. In any state, mercury is a strong conductor of electricity, though it does not conduct heat well. As a liquid, it has traditionally been used to tell the temperature, since its volume will expand or contract depending on how warm or cold it is. As a solid, it is ductile and malleable and can be shaped or cut. It is an integral component in many consumer products, from fluorescent light bulbs to dental amalgam fillings. As a gas, it is a dangerous pollutant which can be detrimental and, on certain occasions, deadly to human health.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d6\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://engineering.mit.edu/engage/ask-an-engineer/why-is-mercury-liquid-at-room-temperature/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"MIT School of Engineering | » Why is mercury liquid at room ... Why is mercury liquid at room temperature? All metals turn liquid at some temperature. This one happens to be useful… By Sarah Jensen When we call someone “mercurial,” we’re invoking the Roman god Mercury whose swift movements from place to place gives us the adjective meaning “erratic or volatile.” He also lent his name to the metal mercury, a quick-silvery liquid we’re most familiar with through its role in thermometers. Though we know most metals in their solid state, all of them melt too if they get hot enough, says Craig Carter, a professor of materials science and engineering. Some metals melt at lower temps than others. Tin becomes liquid at 231.8˚C (447.8˚F); at the other end of the spectrum, tungsten has the highest melting point of any metal: 3,422˚C (6,192˚F). Somewhere in the middle is mercury, which stays in a liquid state until its temperature drops to -40°. “A metal is full of bonds between the atoms that make it up,” explains Carter. “What determines a material’s melting point has everything to do with the energy associated with the bonds. The formation of the bond transforms some of the kinetic energy into bond energy. The energy of a bond in mercury is very low, so it tends to disorganize at lower temperatures. “Think of the kinetic energy in a thrown baseball,” he suggests. “The work the pitcher does to toss the ball is imparted into velocity, part of the formula used to measure kinetic energy. Now imagine many microscopic balls. They don’t move together with a single velocity, but in random directions, each with its own kinetic energy — and the higher the temperature, the faster and more randomly they move.” The atoms that make up a metal behave in the same way: as temperatures rise, they’re activated by kinetic energy.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d7\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.amnh.org/explore/ology/ology-cards/355-mercury\",\n    \"snippet\": \"mercury | AMNH Mercury is unlike any other metal. At room temperature, it is a shimmering liquid. In nature, mercury is found as a solid in the mineral cinnabar, as well as in natural compounds. This liquid metal is used in thermometers and electronics. Pure liquid mercury gives off toxic vapors. It also combines easily with other substances to form toxic compounds. Pollution from human activity releases mercury into the air, soil, and water. In Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Alice attends a tea party hosted by a peculiar and irritable hat maker. Author Lewis Carroll had a fantastical imagination. But the \\\"Mad Hatter\\\" character had a basis in reality. At that time, many hat makers did behave strangely, leading to the term \\\"mad as a hatter.\\\" Their odd behavior was caused by mercury poisoning. From the 1700s through the early 1900s, hat factories used a mercury compound called mercuric nitrate. Long-term exposure to this poisonous compound led many hat makers to act as if insane or \\\"mad.\\\" Symptoms included tremors, pathological shyness and extreme irritability. China's first emperor, Qin Shihuangdi, took mercury because he believed it would: cure his illness kill him so he could pass the throne to his son make him live forever Correct! Emperor Qin wanted to rule China forever, and he thought mercury would make him immortal. Throughout history, medicines with mercury were taken by millions, from children's author Louisa May Alcott to the French Emperor Napoleon. Today, people get mercury poisoning from: getting vaccinated eating certain fish working in hat factories Correct! Mercury is no longer used in hat making or as a preservative in vaccines.

Lead di-iodide is a solid at room temperature. It melts at 402 °C and boils at 954 °C. In this case, the substance which is a liquid at room temperature has a lower boiling point than the substance which is a solid at room temperature. This is not a general rule, however. For example, mercury is a liquid at room temperature, with a melting point of -38.87 °C. Mercury boils at 357 °C. On the other hand, mercury bromide, HgBr2, is a solid at room temperature with a melting point of 236 °C, and a boiling point of 322 °C, which is less than that of pure mercury. A warning, however.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Titanic scored a global gross of more than $1.8 billion during its initial run, and that total has increased to $2.2 billion with subsequent re-releases. Hollywood’s most impressive success stories. How much of Titanic’s historic gross went back to the studios as profit? Titanic Made An Estimated Profit Of $1.4 Billion At The Box Office Titanic netted an estimated profit of $1.4 billion (via The Hollywood Reporter). With a whopping budget of $210 million ($337 million in today’s dollars), Titanic was the most expensive film ever made at the time of its release. The film’s lifetime gross of $2.2 billion is divided into $1.8 billion from its original theatrical run and $400 million from its re-releases. Adjusted for inflation, Titanic has earned around $3.33 billion. The studios behind Titanic – 20th Century Fox and Paramount Pictures, who split the rights to the film – spent approximately $150 million on marketing. The general rule of thumb is that 50 percent of box office receipts go to the theaters showing the movie, and the other 50% percent comes back to the producers. But Titanic stayed in theaters a lot longer than the average movie, and the longer a movie stays in theaters, the bigger the distributors’ box office percentage becomes. Rather than the standard 50 percent, Fox and Paramount received around 58 percent of Titanic’s box office revenue. The Hollywood Reporter estimates that the studios made $1.4 billion ($1.9 billion today) in profit from Titanic. How Titanic's Box Office Profit Compares To James Cameron's Other Movies Titanic isn’t Cameron’s only commercial hit. Almost all of his other movies have made blockbuster numbers at the box office. According to The Numbers, when Titanic first hit theaters, it was Cameron’s highest-grossing movie by far. But his previous films had all been hits (except for The Abyss, which underperformed). Aliens made $183 million, True Lies made $365 million, and Terminator 2: Judgment Day made $515 million.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2023-07-02\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://collider.com/titanic-box-office-budget/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"'Titanic' Budget Breakdown: Is James Cameron's Epic Still ... - Collider The international box office doubled that amount, coming in at just about $1.2 billion, making for a worldwide gross of $1.8 billion. This ... The film would have likely needed to make around $650 million to be considered a success. As we've seen with the recent financial fumbles of high-profile blockbusters like The Flash and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, this accomplishment can be difficult for even the most prominent franchises. In the case of Titanic, a historical fiction film with no pre-established IP, it would ultimately have no problem making its money back and eviscerating every existing box office record with it. How Much Did Titanic Make at the Box Office? On December 19th, 1997, Titanic officially became the most financially successful film of all time. Though the film had a decent opening weekend of $29 million, the number would only go up from there. Remember when we said the film needed $650 million to be considered a success? Well, Titanic made nearly that amount and then some in its debut period in the U.S. alone, with $600 million domestically. The international box office doubled that amount, coming in at just about $1.2 billion, making for a worldwide gross of $1.8 billion. This incredible box office run officially made Titanic the highest-grossing film ever, making almost double the amount of money the previous titleholder, Jurassic Park. However, Titanic record has only increased with several re-releases. The most profitable of these were certainly the 2012 3D re-release, which raked in $350 million, and the recent 25th Anniversary release, which brought in $70 million. With the re-releases, the current worldwide total of Titanic is about $2.3 billion.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2023-08-12\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Titanic-(1997)\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Titanic (1997) - Financial Information - The Numbers It made $600 million while the second highest-grossing film at the time had barely topped $400 million.

Its complete total is now $2.04 billion, which is a stunning figure. The majority of the film's weekend haul came from China, where it broke records with $67 million, which broke Transformers: Dark of the Moon's record opening weekend in that market. The film remained in top spot in Russia with $3.15 million on 972 screens for a total of $10.34 million after two. Its total in the U.K. rose to $12.68 million after two weeks of release, including $2.87 million on 429 screens this past weekend. At this point, I can imagine studio heads looking at every film that earned more than $300 million and trying to figure out if they can be converted to 3D or not. If it only costs $18 million to convert a film and it can make $200 million worldwide, it's an easy way to make money. Of course, it's also an easy way to over-saturate the market to the point of no return. More... Titanic 3D opened in China and earned $7 million on 64 IMAX screens.

The movie opened by earning $28,638,131 during its first weekend and grossed over $1.8 billion worldwide. Why did James Cameron make the movie? The reason why James Cameron made ‘Titanic’: How much money did the movie make at the box office? The movie was a huge box office success, which won eleven Oscars at the 1998 Academy Awards Ceremony, but why did he make it? In 1997 when James Cameron’s ‘Titanic’ was released, it wasn’t expected to do as well as it did, or have the overwhelming praise it has received over the years. With a love story set on a doomed passenger liner ship, the movie follows Jack Dawson and Rose Dewitt Bukater played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. The young stars, who were in their early twenties at the time of filming, each made a name for themselves following the success of the film, leading successful careers in the years since the movie premiered. Despite the film’s success, the movie had a difficult creative process, with budget increases, longer than expected shooting days, and requests to make the film shorter, which all made the movie a gamble for movie studios to invest in. Here’s how it made its mark on the world of cinema. How much money did ‘Titanic’ make at the box office? With an original budget of $110 million, the cost of creating a new sound stage complete with horizon tanks to emulate the look of the ocean pushed the budget to $200 million and later to $295 million. Shooting was extended from 138 to 160 days with a delayed release from July 1997 to December, forcing Paramount and Fox studios to agree, having already invested so much into the film. The final film spanned just over three hours, with no A-List celebrities on the credits. Cameron ignored requests to shorten the movie, and went so far as toforfeit his salary and percentage of gross (an estimated $8,000,000) in order to give the movie the green light to be shown at 194 minutes. The result? The movie opened by earning $28,638,131 during its first weekend and grossed over $1.8 billion worldwide.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2023-06-23\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d6\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Titanic-1997-movie-make-a-billion-dollars-worldwide\",\n    \"snippet\": \"How did the Titanic 1997 movie make a billion dollars worldwide?

Before filming, the director said she sent him a rose with a note that said, \\\"I'm ready. \\\" After the film's release, Cameron reshot a scene so it would accurately depict the sky on the night the Titanic sank. Neil deGrasse Tyson told Cameron that Rose wouldn't be able to see the moon. Paramount Pictures After the ship sinks in \\\"Titanic,\\\" Rose floats on a door in the North Atlantic Ocean and stares at the sky, awaiting rescue. However, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson pointed out that the sky in the movie doesn't look the way it did on the actual night the Titanic sank. In the early hours of April 15, 1912, there was no visible moon in the sky, and the stars looked different, according to Tyson. So as Cameron prepared the film's relaunched 3D version (2012), he reshot the scene to accurately reflect the sky that night. Cameron based the elderly couple lying in bed together as the Titanic sinks on real passengers. Isidor and Ida Straus were on the Titanic. Paramount Pictures Isidor Straus was a co-owner of Macy's and a former US Congress member. He has his wife, Ida, were passengers on the Titanic's 1912 maiden voyage. They both died during the disaster. Actors Lew Palter and Elsa Raven portrayed the Straus couple in the film, appearing as two elderly people clutching each other in bed as the vessel sinks. In a deleted scene, the couple decides to stay on board and go down with the ship.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2023-06-21\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d8\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/news/ni63947652/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"James Cameron Gave Up His Backend Box Office Profit Potential To ...

(To celebrate \\\"Titanic\\\" and its impending 25th-anniversary re-release, we've put together a week of explorations, inquires, and deep dives into James Cameron's box office-smashing disaster epic.)

The film had a budget of 200 million; at the time of this writing, the worldwide gross is over 2 billion, according to Box Office Mojo. That's a pretty good take for the studio, but director James Cameron didn't make that much on it. While that sounds astounding, there is a pretty good reason for it. The story of the aristocratic Rose (Kate Winslet), whose father has died and left her and her mother (Frances Fisher) penniless, the poor artist Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), their love story, and the sinking of the famous ocean liner has captivated fans for a quarter of a century now.

He also utilized footage of the sunken ship in the film, something no other Titanic film had done. With his $200 million budget, Cameron was able to rebuild the ship's exterior and many of its interiors to a tee. The film set's main staircase shares an uncanny resemblance to the one passengers actually used back in 1912. For followers of the ship and its history, it meant a lot that Cameron honored the Titanic with his accuracy. Of course, he also included historical figures like Molly Brown and Captain Smith, making the story really come to life on the screen. Titanic Had Huge Star Power With Its Cast When Cameron cast Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet in the roles of Jack and Rose, neither was the Hollywood star they are today. Leo had filmed Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, but the film had yet to premiere. Luckily, Luhrmann's film came out a year before Titanic, launching Leo into the spotlight as the latest teen heartthrob in what the media would begin to call Leo Mania. Kate was best known for her work in Sense & Sensibility alongside Emma Thompson, which earned Kate her first Oscar nomination. Once Titanic premiered, Leo and Kate's careers really took off, meaning when the film was still in theaters almost a year after its initial release, more fans were running to theaters to see Jack and Rose's love story play out. Some other famous faces in the film were Kathy Bates, Billy Zane, and Bill Condon, but it's safe to say it was Leo and Kate that made the film such a success. Aside from their star power, Leo and Kate had undeniable chemistry on the screen that made fans believe in their love story.

Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON. The rest is plain text.\n- ≥80% of final-answer sentences include [dX] (unless abstaining).\n- Use an EM DASH \" — \" in the label line (not hyphen or en dash).\n- Be precise and faithful; no new facts; respect length budgets.\n\nInputs:\n\n- query:\n{query}\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n{retrieved_docs}\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n{per_doc_notes}\n\nTask:\n1) Follow the full OUTPUT CONTRACT exactly.\n   • <think> block with:\n       (A) VALID JSON array for EVERY doc d1…dN (order-preserving, one object per doc; if verdict==\"irrelevant\" set key_fact=\"\")\n       (B) Conflict reasoning FIRST: cluster docs, reference doc IDs, and NAME the mechanism (temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive)\n       (C) ONE label line: \"<ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\"\n       (D) Brief reasoning connecting evidence to the final answer (or abstention)\n   • ONE blank line\n   • Final answer (or exactly \"CANNOT ANSWER, INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\" if abstaining)\n   • Final sentinel line [[END-OF-ANSWER]].\n\nReminders (DO NOT PRINT):\n- Reason FIRST for the conflict: write the analysis in (B), THEN emit the label line in (C); the label must be a direct consequence of the reasoning.\n- Conflict taxonomy (strict): No conflict / Complementary information / Conflicting opinions or research outcomes / Conflict due to outdated information / Conflict due to misinformation.\n- Use only existing doc_ids in bracketed citations [dX]; no ranges like d1–d5; never cite out-of-bounds [dK].\n- Prefer high-credibility sources and order citations high→low in the evidence list.\n- If any doc is \"supports\" or \"partially supports\", DO NOT abstain.\n- Close </think> before the answer; no extra text outside the required format."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Inputs:\n\n- query:\nCan ideas be patented?\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://ipwatchdog.com/2018/11/17/protecting-idea-can-ideas-be-patented/id=103389/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Protecting an Idea: Can Ideas Be Patented or Protected? Protecting an Idea: Can Ideas Be Patented or Protected? Many people ask: can ideas be patented? The short answer is no. Unfortunately, despite what you may have heard from late night television commercials, there is no effective way to protect an idea with any form of intellectual property protection. Copyrights protect expression and creativity, not innovation. Patents protect inventions. Neither copyrights or patents protect ideas. This is not to suggest that ideas are not valuable, but they are not valuable in the same way or sense that pop culture has led many to believe. It is, of course, axiomatic that an idea is an essential first step toward any invention. Nothing can or will happen without an idea, so in one sense ideas are a critical, and valuable, piece to the overall innovation equation. In and of themselves, however, ideas are not monetarily valuable. Without some identifiable manifestation of the idea there can be no intellectual property protection obtained and no exclusive rights will flow. Without any protection, whether actual (i.e., in the form of an issued patent) or perceived (i.e., in the form of a pending patent application that defines the invention and could if pursued mature into an issued patent), ideas are free. Absent patent protection or a confidentiality agreement that accepts an obligation not use or disclose an idea – which are extremely difficult if not impossible to obtain with only an idea – the idea can be taken and used without payment. While confidentiality agreements, or non-disclosure agreements as they are sometimes called, are absolutely essential for inventors in the early stages to protect their idea, the problem is they are only going to provide protection with respect to those who have accepted the confidentiality obligation. And if and when the confidentiality obligation is broken you only have a claim for breach of contract (i.e., breach of the confidentiality agreement), but the trade secret that was your invention will no longer be a secret.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.upcounsel.com/what-can-be-patented\",\n    \"snippet\": \"What Can Be Patented: Everything You Need to Know What Can Be Patented: Everything You Need to Know An invention can be patented if it has a useful purpose, has patentable subject matter, is novel, and is non-obvious. 6 min read Updated July 2, 2020: What Can Be Patented? An invention can be patented if it has a useful purpose, has patentable subject matter, is novel, and is non-obvious. The patent could cover a composition, production process, machine, tool, new plant species, or an upgrade to an existing invention. Inventors must meet certain government guidelines to get a patent. Government rules for patents ask certain things of the applicant. They need to show or describe the invention in a way that a patent officer can understand. They don't need a prototype to apply. An applicant can show proof of concept on paper. What Does the Government List as \\\"Patentable Subject Matter\\\"? The government has a group of subjects that it names as \\\"patentable subject matter.\\\" These items include: A new plant type that exists through asexual reproduction. A new composition or formula. A machine, usually one with moving parts or circuitry. A process or method i.e. a new way of doing something better and/or more efficiently. A simple tool or the like that can do something: Examples are things like pencils, hammers, screwdrivers, and baskets. All of them do a specific task. New tools have value and are patentable for that reason. Examples of patentable items: Business methods Computer software Computer hardware Computer accessories Games Internet advances Jewelry Machines Magic tricks Makeup Musical instruments Perfumes Plants Sporting Goods What's Not Eligible for a Patent? The government won't patent an idea. It doesn't matter how revolutionary and creative that idea is. In a way, every invention starts with an idea. Since you can't patent an idea, how do patents exist? The answer is that you have to get the idea down on paper.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/can-you-patent-an-idea\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Can you patent an idea? | Legalzoom Can you patent an idea?

The statements and opinions are the expression of the author, not LegalZoom, and have not been evaluated by LegalZoom for accuracy, completeness, or changes in the law. Contents The simple answer is no—you cannot patent an idea for an invention. The invention itself has to be produced or a patent application containing the invention must be filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). While all inventions start with an idea, not every idea can be called an invention. Understanding the difference between ideas and inventions is critical to understanding the core ideas about patents, what a patent is, how to get a patent, and when to file a patent. Here are a few things to keep in mind. What is a utility patent? There are many different kinds of patents, but when most people talk about patents, they usually mean utility patents. Utility patents protect four kinds of things. They are: A process. A process is any combination of steps or methods. A machine. A machine is any combination of parts. A manufacture. A manufacture is a combination of materials to make something new. A new composition of matter. A new composition of matter could be a chemically new substance, like a drug or other formula. In reality, many inventions are combinations of these categories. For example, a new telecommunication system may combine processes and machines. Or, a new kind of concrete may combine new combinations of existing materials as well as completely new chemicals. One way to tell if your idea is an invention is if you can describe it in the terms utility patents protect. If you cannot tell if it is a process, a machine or some combination of the two, your invention may still be an idea, which you cannot patent. What you can patent and what you cannot patent Even if your invention fits under the law, not everything can be patented. Determining which kinds of inventions are protectable will further help to determine if your idea is an invention. Inventions cannot be too abstract.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.mondaq.com/india/patent/810450/can-ideas-be-patented\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Can Ideas Be Patented? - Patent - India India: Can Ideas Be Patented? To print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq.com. Introduction Patentability of an idea is one of the controversial topics faced during the grant of patents. There is a very fine line difference between an idea and an invention because every invention is first an idea which later matures and gets patented. On the face of it, it seems that there is no substantial way to protect an idea under intellectual properties. Copyright protects literary and artistic works but not innovations and patent protects noval and unique inventions. Even though idea is first step towards an invention and is of significant importance, there is no monetary value attached to it, as per law. Inventors prefer to have a non-disclosure or a confidentiality agreement in the initial stage of their invention development in order to protect their idea. However, such an agreement is not binding any other person or organisation except the one signing the agreement. So, if any third party, not being a party to the agreement, discloses or uses the idea cannot be sued upon by the inventor. For an idea to be protected within the Patent laws, it is essential that the idea should not be ambiguous and vague. Mere idea cannot be protected but when the idea is concrete with enough specificity and one has a strategy to describe it and its functioning, making it an asset valuable enough to be protected, then such an idea can be protected. Herein after, various conditions and requirements for a patent has been discussed concluding to provide situations where an idea can be patented under Indian laws. Patent Patent is a kind of intellectual property that grants certain legal rights to the owner of such IP against the unauthorised selling, using, making or sharing of any of his work or invention for a limited period of time. Patent, in other words, can be said to be a license granted to the inventor giving him exclusive rights over his invention, be it a process or a product, for a certain period of time.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d5\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.rocketlawyer.com/business-and-contracts/intellectual-property/patents/legal-guide/why-cant-you-patent-an-idea\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Why Can't You Patent an Idea? What Can You Patent - Rocket Lawyer Share this Why Can't You Patent an Idea? What You Can Actually Patent Good ideas are a dime a dozen, but they generally can't be patented. Although you don't have to have a working prototype to apply for a patent, you do have to be able to describe the invention in detail and show how it will work. The idea alone isn't enough; you must be able to demonstrate the usefulness and functionality of your idea. Start Your Provisional Patent Application Patents are granted for inventions or designs that meet four general criteria. Different industries and types of products may have slightly different requirements, but all patent applications must: Demonstrate aesthetic design or functional utility, depending on whether you're applying for a design patent or a utility patent. Show novelty compared to existing products, inventions, or designs. Prove uniquenesss and non-obviousness to individuals with ordinary skills in the field of the patent. Provide a complete explanation of the design or invention, with full details and specific examples. Certain things can never be patented, regardless of how well they meet these four standards. They include the elements, theoretical plans, laws of nature, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas. So patenting fire or the wheel is out, though some people have tried. When trying to patent something that is still in the theoretical stage, you'll have to make sure that you are as precise as possible. Otherwise, the USPTO will not grant the patent even if you're trying to patent a great idea. Providing diagrams can help you significantly, as they provide specificity. Remember to include more than one diagram, and also provide as many examples as you can. Don't be afraid of seeming to be repetitive if you list multiple specific uses and forms in which the invention is distinct and novel.

On Monday, the Supreme Court will consider when the government should grant patents to processes that are based on abstract ideas. In a world where technology is rapidly changing, the Patent and Trademark Office has been flooded with applications that claim to have invented ways to solve problems. But it can be hard to discern if these creations should be patentable. The number of patent applications has more than tripled in the last two decades, and the number of patents granted has multiplied two and a half times. But many of those patents appear to be overly broad and vague, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office. That increase has contributed to a surge in costly, and often frivolous, patent-infringement lawsuits. The issue in this case, Alice Corporation Pty. v. CLS Bank International, is whether using a computer to implement a well-established economic concept can be patented. The court should rule that such ideas are not eligible for patent protection. Alice Corporation obtained four American patents that cover a method of settling trades between investors in currency and other financial markets. The approach depends on a neutral middleman to make sure traders complete the transactions they have agreed to. The corporation, which is based in Australia, has accused CLS Bank, a London-based company that settles foreign exchange trades for investors around the world, of infringing its patents. In several earlier cases, including one decided in 2010, the Supreme Court has ruled that “abstract ideas” and “fundamental economic practices” cannot be patented, because they are basic tools of scientific and technological activity. In the 2010 case, Bilski v. Kappos, for example, the court upheld a decision by the patent office not to grant a patent to a system that businesses could use to hedge the risk of changing energy prices.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d8\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03438-x\",\n    \"snippet\": \"How to turn your ideas into patents Thank you for visiting nature.com.

A fear of a discovery being scooped can create a race between researchers to publish their results as a peer-reviewed paper. But if there is a commercial goal in mind, patent filing should come first: patent laws generally favour whomever is first to file an application that completely discloses a fresh invention. Researchers should keep in mind three important elements that make an idea patentable. First, the invention must be new: the same idea can’t have been published before in any form. Publications by the inventors themselves (this would include academic papers as well as talks at scientific conferences or demonstrations to potential customers) can destroy a patent application. Presentations at internal laboratory meetings are OK, but if there are external collaborators present, it is essential for everyone to commit to a project agreement with a non-disclosure clause, to protect any potential patents. Second, there must be some inventive step of ‘non-obviousness’.

They become ropes that push and when distributed properly, can be used to control the shape of a surface. “I am not sure if the idea is used anywhere else, but I found another use for it when a large Rhode Island-based toy company came to us fishing for ideas,” Gieseke said. “In response, I applied the ideas to a toy fish Oscillating Appendage For Fin Propulsion.” When Gieseke comes up with a new idea, he never knows if it will end up being implemented in the future, but regardless of the end result, he views the patent process as important and well worth the time and effort. “I’m not sure if any of the ideas I pumped through the patenting process will amount to anything, but maybe the next patent will be ‘the one,’” said Gieseke. “The only way to find out is to write it up and see what happens. The surest way for an idea to die is for no one else to see it.” Jim Kasischke, supervisory patent counsel in Division Newport’s Office of Counsel, said that it’s wise for employees to try to patent their ideas because 90 percent of their ideas can be patented. To start the process, inventors should gather enough information to submit an invention disclosure. The invention disclosure should include a description of the invention by stating the problem that needs solving, what the Division is currently doing, and how the invention proposes to solve the problem in a new way. The description also highlights the advantages of the invention, has a photo, or preferably a drawing, and states how the invention is enabled to solve the problem. “The more the invention disclosure is developed, the easier it is to prepare a patent application,” Kasischke said. The invention disclosure requires the signature of two people with associated technical knowledge and the signature of the department security official.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d10\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://sites.google.com/pdx.edu/iip/home/ip-primer/patents-primer\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Innovation & Intellectual Property - Patents Primer Patents Patents as a form of intellectual property are meant to protect inventions - ideas that are new in the world and can spur innovation. The ideas they protect, although often spelled out in great detail in patent documents, are by their nature abstract (although must have a real world embodiment, see below). A patent for a chair, if written well, doesn’t just protect one chair but anything that has the specific attributes of a chair covered in the patent. What can be patented? Ideas that can be patented include processes (some method that produces a result), machines, articles of manufacture, compositions of matter (chemical compounds or alloys), or improvements to any of those items. Although we say ‘ideas’ and that patent protection is by its nature abstract, there is also a requirement that the patent describes how to make a tangible implementation or embodiment of the idea, or in patent language a “reduction to practice.” The above are known as utility patents - there are also design patents that cover ornamental designs and plant patents for bred varieties of asexually produced plants. What are patents good for? Patents take a long time to obtain, and we can spend years processing any given application with the patent office. Because we use patent attorneys and agents to help us with this process, obtaining a patent can be very expensive. An issued patent gives rights to its owner (the right to prevent others from using, making, selling, offering for sale, or importing) for 20 years from the date of filing the application. For these reasons, the use of patents to promote PSU innovations is best suited to ideas that have a long product development time or are ‘platform’ ideas that can be adapted to many future iterations of related products or services. Some research results may fit better into this category than others, and part of our evaluation of whether or not to pursue a patent will take this notion into account. For example, although some elements of software can be patented, software product life cycles tend to be faster than drugs or medical devices and an expensive patent strategy may not always be the best route for this type of innovation.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe;

A Complete Guide to Branding an ... This makes the internet much more organized, helping both people and search engines understand exactly what a site is about. Industry-specific domain names have important implications, especially for brands with online stores. For example, ecommerce jumped by 68% in 2020. Brands without an online store scrambled to carve out a presence for themselves online. The process of choosing domain names is often associated with a lack of availability of good domain names – leading to compromises and frustration. But thanks to ICANN’s efforts, brands need not compromise on their domain name anymore. They have an alternative. The .STORE domain was launched in 2016. It has since become the preferred choice for more than 475,000 successful businesses. Best of all? Ecommerce newcomers can still get in on the short, snappy, attractive titles – and still, rank in Google search. A domain extension that reflects your exact industry or service is better than a string of characters with a .com attached to it. That’s because Store and St0re might be the same to a human reader, but they aren’t to Google. Why a .STORE Domain Is Good for SEO Remember back in the day when you learned about which domain extensions were “more credible” than others? Those days are gone. Google has stated on the record that they treat all domain extensions the same. You won’t get penalized if you don’t have a .com at the end of your domain name. There are a lot of online stores using .STORE domain names and many are very successful. They’ve set up their online stores properly, adhering to SEO best practices. They’re ranking well for their keywords, and the search engines like .STORE websites just as much as they do websites on other TLDs. Bill Hartzer, SEO Consultant & Domain Name Expert That makes a .STORE domain valuable for any brand with an online store. Here are eight reasons why a .STORE domain is very good for SEO. 1.

Thus, check both .com and .net options on a domain checker and purchase both domains if possible. One more thing you should be aware of is that your contact details are visible through WHOIS lookup tools. To protect your personal data, consider implementing domain privacy protection. Conclusion Both .com and .net are viable domain name extensions for business websites, but remember to keep their differences in mind before getting yourself a domain. The .com extension is designed for general use – specifically for websites that make money online. For that reason, it’s a widely used extension, so it might be more challenging to find a .com domain extension available. On the other hand, many technology experts prefer to use a .net domain extension as it is more fitting for businesses that deal with technology and other internet services. Compared to .com, it’ll be easier to find a .net domain name for your website. When it comes to SEO, there’s no difference between .com vs .net websites. Your overall SEO strategy is more important for Google and other search engines than the domain extension itself. We hope this article helped you understand when to use .com vs .net domains. Make sure to register your domain while it’s available by purchasing it through a domain name registrar or together with your web hosting plan. Read More About Domain Names .com vs .net FAQs Are There Any Restrictions on .com or .net Domains? There are some restrictions on .com and .net domains, but they are generally minimal. These domains are open for registration by anyone without any specific requirements. However, domain registrars and registries may have their own policies and restrictions regarding trademark infringement, abusive behavior, or illegal activities. Is .com Better Than .net for SEO? Neither .com nor .net domains have an inherent advantage for SEO. Both can rank well in search engines if optimized correctly. The choice between .com and .net should be based on the relevance to your business, availability, and brand preference rather than SEO considerations. Which One, Between .com vs .net, Should I Use for My Business Website?\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.practicalecommerce.com/how-domain-names-impact-seo\",\n    \"snippet\": \"How Domain Names Impact SEO - Practical Ecommerce To my knowledge, Google never stated that its algorithm considers the age of a domain name. Google personnel have confirmed the opposite on many occasions. Yet marketers even today seek second-hand domains, falsely believing age alone can help rankings. Domain registration length is not a ranking factor. Another persistent SEO myth is to register a domain name for years in advance, supposedly signaling to Google your commitment to that site. That is not to say that domain registration has no importance. For example, Google has stated that a change in domain ownership is a ranking factor. That implies that Google might use the registration to identify all domain names under the same owner. It also implies there’s no point in investing in expired domains to claim their rankings or backlinks. Google will know those domains have changed owners and will devalue past signals. Domain authority does not impact rankings. I’ve addressed the misplaced reliance of domain authority on SEO. The gist is that Google uses backlink metrics on a page level, never on a domain. “Domain authority” is an invention by SEO practitioners that has nothing to do with Google’s algorithm. Domain names do not aggregate backlink equity from all their pages. It is a myth that leads to poor marketing decisions. Top-level domains (.com) are not a ranking factor. Several years ago, a .com domain provided SEO advantages, particularly for commercial-intent searches. That is no longer the case. Google now treats all non-local domain names equally. Moreover, Google has stated that it ignores keywords in top-level domains, such as .attorney, .seo, .events. However, local domains (e.g., .ca, .ru, .au) remain a strong ranking factor for local search results. For example, a searcher in Canada is more likely to encounter a .ca domain in the results. Domain Names Remain Important Domain names do not directly impact organic rankings. But choosing a memorable name is still essential. An easy-to-remember domain improves branding and name recognition, which produce many ancillary benefits such as higher search-result clicks and better on-page engagement. Both are direct ranking factors. Domain names are prominent in Google’s search-result snippets and can thus affect clicks.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.siteguru.co/seo-academy/domain-names-and-seo\",\n    \"snippet\": \"How Your Domain Name Affects SEO | SiteGuru The same goes for Ahrefs’ Domain Rating (DR). While it’s useful as a gauge of your link-building efforts, Google doesn’t officially use it. We mainly use it in SEO conversations because, among other factors, Moz’s DA looks at your backlink profile. Since Google uses links to understand your website, DA is a good proxy for understanding how your website compares to others in your niche. Myth: Top-level domains have a direct impact on SEO Truth: Top-level domains no longer affect your SEO The final myth is that your top-level domain or domain extension gives you better search engine rankings. Think of top-level domains as identifiers; they give bots pointers about the nature or location of your website. For example, .edu domains identified educational institutions. .gov is a sponsored domain, reserved for the use of the US government. While, in the past, .com domains provided a definite SEO advantage because they allowed bots to easily identify what the website is about, it’s no longer the case. Google now treats all non-local domains the same. As such, the Google algorithm will treat your site the same, whether it has a .com, .net, or any other non-local domain. Why Is Your Domain Name Important If It Doesn’t Affect Your SEO? Your domain name may not affect your SEO directly, but it can affect it indirectly. Your domain name defines your brand and lets users know who you are, which, in turn, creates trust and authority. As the right domain name shows professionalism, it adds credibility to your site, so the right name can give you an edge over your competitors. With more trust and credibility, more searchers will click on your website’s link in the SERPs. As a result, your site’s click-through rates and on-page engagement will improve. And as these are direct ranking factors, your domain name indirectly impacts your site’s SEO.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d5\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://victoriousseo.com/blog/com-vs-net-seo/\",\n    \"snippet\": \".com vs .net for SEO: Which Is Better? - Victorious So Do .com Domains Rank Higher? Overall, there’s virtually no difference between .com vs .net SEO performance. Both extensions can be used to produce high-performing websites. The .com domain extension is by far the most common, so from a branding perspective, it’s sometimes preferred because there’s a sense of trust instilled when someone sees .com. But search engines aren’t using these extensions as ranking factors that boost or hurt your potential to pull in organic traffic. Thus, websites using either of these extensions can employ a wide range of SEO best practices to influence their position in search engine results. It’s important to note, this is true even beyond the .com/.net comparison. Domain extensions like .io, .info, .us, or .me are ALL capable of ranking for competitive keywords and have no built-in advantages or disadvantages from a pure SEO perspective. But from a branding perspective, .com remains the smartest option for most businesses. It’s important to remember that the majority of internet users will enter a .com address when guessing your company site, as it’s the most common URL format. Additionally, while alternative domain extensions have gained popularity in recent years, .com addresses are the most trusted by consumers. They’re usually going to be the best option for B2C companies. Is There Ever a Case Where Domain Extensions Are a Ranking Factor? Let’s say you’re a company based in Russia. If you use the .ru extension (the official country code top-level domain for that particular country), your website will be more likely to rank well within Russia. Thus, if you’re an American company looking to open an official Mexico branch where you’ll have dedicated products or services to customers across the country, you might want to consider the pros and cons of choosing an .mx domain. Note, this is different than if you’re an American company that’s simply serving a version of your website in Spanish. In this case, you would use a subdirectory (like /es/) and have versions of your English content served in Spanish.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  }\n]\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"Google treats all domain extensions equally, so having a .com domain does not provide an SEO advantage.\",\n    \"quote\": \"Google has stated on the record that they treat all domain extensions the same.

Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

The idea of adding chlorine to public drinking systems first gained traction around the end of the 19th century. People had long battled a variety of ailments that were spread through water, including diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and typhoid. When scientists recognized that adding chlorine in small amounts to drinking water could kill bacteria and microbes in the public water system and help slow or even stop the spread of these water-borne diseases, the idea of adding chlorine to water supplies became popular quickly. In 1897, Maidstone, England became the first town to have its water supply entirely treated with chlorine. Soon after, the idea spread to the United States, finding its place in local water systems and even gaining popularity in the U.S. military. Today, chlorination is the most common water treatment method worldwide, particularly in the U.S. where it’s used heavily. What are the harmful effects of chlorine for you and your family? The shadow side of chlorinated water is becoming more apparent all the time. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, Americans now are consuming 300-600 times the amount of chlorine that is safe to ingest. Why is chlorine in drinking water dangerous? Because when chlorine mixes with even minute amounts of organic compounds that are very often found in water, harmful by-products, called Trihalomethanes (THMs) are produced. These by-products produce free radicals in the body, which trigger cell damage — and are highly carcinogenic, even in small amounts. As scientists have looked into the potentially dangerous effects of chlorine, use of the chemical has been linked to a wide range of ailments, including various cancers, reproductive problems, problems with the immune system, and heart attacks. Here is some of the research showing the harmful effects of consuming chlorine in water: In the small town of Roseto, Pennsylvania, after changing from drinking mountain spring water to drinking chlorinated tap water, the population went from having no heart attacks to having heart attacks, with no changes to their diets.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_chlorination\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Water chlorination - Wikipedia The technique of purification of drinking water by use of compressed liquefied chlorine gas was developed by a British officer in the Indian Medical Service, ... History In a paper published in 1894, it was formally proposed to add chlorine to water to render it \\\"germ-free\\\". Two other authorities endorsed this proposal and published it in many other papers in 1895.[4] Early attempts at implementing water chlorination at a water treatment plant were made in 1893 in Hamburg, Germany. In 1897 the town of Maidstone, England was the first to have its entire water supply treated with chlorine.[5] Permanent water chlorination began in 1905, when a faulty slow sand filter and a contaminated water supply caused a serious typhoid fever epidemic in Lincoln, England.[6] Alexander Cruickshank Houston used chlorination of the water to stop the epidemic. His installation fed a concentrated solution of so-called \\\"chlorinated lime\\\" (a mixture of calcium hypochlorite, calcium hydroxide and calcium chloride) to the water being treated. This was not simply modern calcium chloride, but contained chlorine gas dissolved in lime-water (dilute calcium hydroxide) to form calcium hypochlorite (chlorinated lime). The chlorination of the water supply helped stop the epidemic and as a precaution, the chlorination was continued until 1911 when a new water supply was commissioned.[7] Manual Control Chlorinator for the liquefaction of chlorine for water purification, early 20th century. From Chlorination of Water by Joseph Race, 1918. The first continuous use of chlorine in the United States for disinfection took place in 1908 at Boonton Reservoir (on the Rockaway River), which served as the supply for Jersey City, New Jersey.[8] Chlorination was achieved by controlled additions of dilute solutions of chloride of lime (calcium hypochlorite) at doses of 0.2 to 0.35 ppm.

Chloramines are a group of chemical compounds that contain chlorine and ammonia. The type of chloramine used to kill germs in drinking water is called monochloramine. Disinfection byproducts are chemicals made when chlorine or chloramine come into contact with dirt or other materials in water. At high enough levels, disinfection byproducts can cause health problems over time. How it works To prevent illnesses, utilities must meet water quality standards. These standards include rules about the levels of germs, disinfectants, and disinfection byproducts that can be in public tap water. Following these rules, utilities add low levels of chlorine or chloramine to kill germs during water treatment. Safe levels of chlorine and chloramine Chlorine or chloramine levels up to 4 milligrams per liter (mg/L), or 4 parts per million (ppm), are considered safe in drinking water. These low levels kill harmful germs and are unlikely to make people sick. Why utilities switch disinfectants Both chlorine and chloramine are good at killing germs in water. However, each has certain benefits and drawbacks, so utilities sometimes switch between them. Switching to chlorine Water pipes can grow a slimy layer of germs (called a biofilm). This layer helps protect the germs from being killed by disinfectants. Utilities may temporarily switch from chloramine to chlorine disinfection to help remove this slime layer. Switching to chloramine Chlorine gets used up quickly in water. Sometimes there is not enough chlorine left to keep killing germs by the time the water reaches your tap.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-02-14\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d6\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.health.state.mn.us/communities/environment/water/factsheet/chlorination.html\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Drinking Water Chlorination: Frequently Asked Questions - MN Dept ... Drinking water chlorination is the addition of chlorine to drinking water systems. It is the most common type of drinking water disinfection. Contact Info Drinking Water Chlorination: Frequently Asked Questions What is drinking water chlorination? Drinking water chlorination is the addition of chlorine to drinking water systems. It is the most common type of drinking water disinfection. Disinfection kills bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms that cause disease and immediate illness. Chlorine is effective and continues to keep the water safe as it travels from the treatment plant to the consumer's tap. A little over 100 years ago, waterborne diseases like typhoid fever and dysentery were a common part of life in the United States —and a common cause of death, too. In the early 1900s, cities started disinfecting drinking water supplies to kill bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms. Both the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regard disinfection of drinking water as one of the most important advances in public health. Is drinking water chlorination required? Chlorination or other continuous disinfection (disinfection that protects from the treatment plant to the consumer’s tap) is required for public water systems that: Use surface water, such as rivers, lakes, and streams, as their source; Have treatment processes that expose the water to outside or open air; or Add treatment chemicals for corrosion control; these chemicals can feed microorganisms and cause them to grow. Disinfection is recommended but not required for other community public water systems. Is chlorinated water safe to drink? Yes. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) limits the amount of chlorine in drinking water to levels that are safe for human consumption. The levels of chlorine used for drinking water disinfection are unlikely to cause long-term health effects. During water treatment, chlorine can combine with naturally occurring organic matter in the water to form compounds called disinfection byproducts (DBPs). DBPs can cause negative health effects after regular, long-term exposure. The EPA has set limits for several types of DBPs.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-10-17\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d7\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/healthlinkbc-files/drinking-water-chlorination-facts\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Drinking Water Chlorination Facts - HealthLink BC Chlorine disinfectants were first added to a public water supply in North America in 1908.

The largest amount of chlorine on earth is in the oceans as sodium chloride or salt. Salt and water are the most common ingredients used to manufacture the chlorine used in your drinking water. Why is chlorine added to drinking water? Chlorine is a versatile disinfectant that kills many types of bacteria, viruses and parasites (pathogens) that cause water-borne infections. Some water-borne infections can cause severe illness and even death. Water suppliers add chlorine disinfectants to drinking water to protect public health. For more information on water-borne infections, see HealthLinkBC File #49a Water-borne Infections in British Columbia. How long has chlorine been used to disinfect water? Chlorine disinfectants were first added to a public water supply in North America in 1908. By the 1920s, thousands of cities worldwide were using chlorine disinfectants to treat drinking water. There was a drastic reduction in water-borne infections, such as typhoid fever and cholera. Infant mortality also declined. Most cities or towns in Canada use chlorine disinfectants to treat drinking water. How is chlorine added to my drinking water? There are many different chlorine disinfectant products and each is added to water using a different approach. These products can be a solid, liquid or gas, but once added to water they all work in a similar way. For this reason they all get the generic labeling of “chlorine.” Your water supplier chooses the product used in your drinking water based on many factors such as cost, source water, size of the water system and whether other forms of treatment are needed. What is secondary disinfection? After being disinfected, water travels through the distribution system to your home through a network of pipes.

Celebrating 115 Years of Safe Drinking Water Today, on September 26, 2023, we celebrate a historic milestone: the 115th anniversary of continuous chlorine disinfection in U.S. public water supplies. This momentous event, which transformed American public health, unfolded in Jersey City, New Jersey. Safe, accessible drinking water, made possible through water treatment, is often taken for granted. However, this achievement didn't happen overnight and traces back to Jersey City. In the early 1900s, using chlorine to treat drinking water was groundbreaking. It led to a significant reduction in waterborne diseases, with Dr. John L. Leal playing a crucial role. Jersey City faced high rates of waterborne diseases, especially among children. Dr. Leal, a physician and health officer, proposed adding a small amount of \\\"chloride of lime\\\" to drinking water, a revolutionary idea. High-profile court cases paved the way for Dr. Leal and engineer George Warren Fuller to put this concept to the test. By 1914, 53% of U.S. public water supplies used chlorinated water. While we celebrate this achievement, we must remember that the battle for clean water continues. @WHO reports 361,000 children under 5 die annually due to inadequate access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene. Let's join UN in pursuing Sustainable Development Goal 6—clean water and sanitation for all, a crucial step toward other SDGs.

In the United States, the first use of chlorine to disinfect tap water occurred in 1908, beginning in Jersey City, New Jersey, and also in Chicago [d3][d5][d7][d8][d9]. Other sources note that this innovation spread widely in the early 1900s as cities began disinfecting their water supplies [d4][d6].\n[[END-OF-ANSWER]]"}]}

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Mr Hublot is a withdrawn, idiosyncratic character with OCD, scared of change and the outside world. Robot Pet's arrival turns his life upside down: he has to share his home with this very invasive companion. The Moon and the Son, a 30-minute autobiographical animated film by John Canemaker, explores the difficult emotional terrain of father/son relationships as seen through Canemaker's own turbulent relationship with his father. Featuring the voices of noted actors Eli Wallach and John Turturro in the roles of father and son, The Moon and the Son combines memory, fact, conjecture, trial transcripts, audio recordings, home movies, photos, snapshots, and original animation to tell the story of an Italian immigrant's troubled life and the devastating consequences of his actions on his family. In the desolate landscapes of an unforgiving desert, a desperate for water wanderer summons up the strength to follow the muffled sound of dripping liquid, only to pay the high price of pursuing a dream.

Every Oscar Winner for Best Animated Short Film, Ranked This story was first published on February 21, 2019. It has been updated to include the winner of the 96th Academy Awards. Although animated films are as old as cinema itself, it wasn’t until the fifth Academy Awards ceremony, for films released in 1931–32, that the Academy added a category for animated cartoons. By that point, the Golden Age of Animation was in full swing — every major studio either operated an animation unit or contracted an independent production company to provide theatrical cartoons to accompany its films. These shorts dominated the Oscars for roughly 30 years — until the studios shuttered their animation departments in the early 1960s. From there, independent and international filmmakers took over the category, a trend that continued through the ’70s and ’80s. By the beginning of the 1990s, studios like Pixar, Aardman, and Blue Sky revitalized animation in the English-speaking world and brought a vigor to the art form that led to the formation of the Best Animated Feature category. Now animation is the second-biggest branch of the Academy, and the Animated Short Film category has awarded films from more than 20 countries in almost every style of animation. The 92 winners of the Best Animated Short Oscar are a microcosm of the history of world animation. Ranking them, one learns just how the definition of what constitutes animation has expanded from the colored cells of “Three Little Pigs” to the cutouts-on-acetate collage of “Frank Film.” From some ambitious misfires to timeless classics that help define the medium, here is an attempt to rank every cartoon to win. Note: Many rankings have changed since this article’s initial publication. Those listed below can be considered definitive. That is, until I change my mind. 92. “Logorama” (2009) “Logorama” makes every building, person, and prop out of corporate logos.

Inspired by the Music of John & Yoko won an Oscar for Best Animated Short Film tonight, marking the first Oscar win for filmmakers Dave Mullins and Brad Booker. Set to the anti-war Christmas classic song by John Lennon and Yoko Ono “Happy Xmas (War Is Over)”, the animated short follows two soldiers at the frontline of World War I as they play a chess game through carrier pigeon, unaware they are on opposing sides of the battle. Watch on Deadline “John Lennon and Yoko Ono wrote a song that inspired us,” said writer-director Dave Mullins as he accepted the award. “Its an antiwar message that we tried to honor with this film, we want to thank our executive producer and creative partner Sean Ono Lennon, who was incredible to work with, our team at ElectroLeague… and I want to thank Thomas Newman for his incredible score.” As the music began to play the trio off, Lennon jumped to the mic for a shout out to Yoko Ono. “I just want to quickly say, my mother turned 91 this February, and today is Mother’s Day in the UK, so could everyone please say Happy Mother’s Day Yoko,” he said as the crowd repeated the refrain. According to a recent New York Times article, Yoko Ono, who has dropped out of the public spotlight, left New York City last year, moving out of the Dakota apartment she famously purchased with John Lennon (she still owns the space). Ono reportedly has retired to the sprawling upstate Catskills farm she purchased with the late Beatle. Her spokesperson Elliot Mintz told The Times Ono no longer gives interviews.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-10\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d6\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/beatles/comments/1bboq13/yall_war_is_over_just_won_best_animated_short/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Y'all, “War is Over” just won Best Animated Short Film at the Oscars!!!!

The Bide-a-Wee Mouse Home has sent the orphan mouse, Nibbles, to spend Thanksgiving with Jerry. But Jerry's cupboard is bare, and Nibbles is always hungry. They start by raiding Tom's milk dish, but Tom wakes up and drains it. Fortunately, Mammy has just put out a huge Thanksgiving feast, just ready for the raiding. And that's just what Jerry and Nibbles do, grabbing Pilgrim hats from the table decorations. All goes fairly well until Nibbles eats a whole orange, which is way too big for him. Jerry smacks him with a spoon, which sends the orange flying, right into Tom's mouth. Tom stalks up to the table in a feather duster, which turns into an Indian headdress. Battle follows, featuring Tom sending flaming cat-tails after the mice, and culminating in a champagne bottle launching Tom into the dish cabinet, which crashes down. Tom waves a white flag, and all three sit down to a polite dinner, but Nibbles eats the whole turkey before anyone else can touch it. The story of a little boy who would only talk in sound effects. With story by Dr. Seuss (and Bill Scott of Rocky and Bullwinkle fame) this cartoon won the Oscar for best short subject (animated) for 1950. This Tom and Jerry cartoon is set in 17th century France. Tom, who is a soldier in the King's castle, is assigned to guard the food laid out on a banquet table. Jerry and a smaller mouse companion, two wandering \\\"mouseketeers,\\\" make the situation miserable for Tom as they abscond with (and occasionally eat) all the food they can.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”;

The widespread small and fresh-appearing tectonic features on the Moon are believed to be young and possibly active (Fig. 1G). In theory, moonquakes generated by the activity of these small structures can be on the same magnitude with the 1906 San Francisco earthquake (Nahm and Velasco, 2013). Elastic waves have a much slower decaying rate on the Moon due to the lack of pore water, the Copernican-aged tectonic features could theoretically release a large amount of stored energy over the entire Moon. Recently, by relocating the possible epicenter for a shallow moonquake recorded by the Apollo seismometers, the possible triggering fault, which is located beneath young compressional structures is revealed (Watters et al., 2019; Senthil Kumar et al., 2019). Interestingly, clusters of rock falls are observed near the lobate scarp, and the falls were interpreted to be caused by the recent fault movement (Senthil Kumar et al., 2019). Impact generated seismic activity can affect areas much larger than the source craters. For example, formation of the < 100 km diameter Copernicus crater on the Moon could trigger ground deformation of ∼ 1–10 m at three radii from the final crater rim (Schultz and Gault, 1976). On the basis of the kilometer-scale topographic roughness across the Moon (Fig. 2A and B), Kreslavsky and Head (2012) noticed a sharp difference in the occurrences of steep slopes between the Late Imbrian and Early Imbrian craters, as terrains older than the Early Imbrian are significantly muted in topography.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(natural_phenomenon)\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Quake (natural phenomenon) - Wikipedia A quake is the result when the surface of a planet, moon or star begins to shake, usually as the consequence of a sudden release of energy transmitted as seismic waves, and potentially with great violence. An earthquake is a phenomenon that results from the sudden release of stored energy in the Earth's crust that creates seismic waves. At the Earth's surface, earthquakes may manifest themselves by a shaking or displacement of the ground and sometimes cause tsunamis, which may lead to loss of life and destruction of property. An earthquake is caused by tectonic plates (sections of the Earth's crust) getting stuck and putting a strain on the ground. The strain becomes so great that rocks give way and fault lines occur. A moonquake is the lunar equivalent of an earthquake (i.e., a quake on the Moon) although moonquakes are caused in different ways. They were first discovered by the Apolloastronauts. The largest moonquakes are much weaker than the largest earthquakes, though their shaking can last for up to an hour, due to fewer attenuating factors to damp seismic vibrations.[1] Information about moonquakes comes from seismometers placed on the Moon from 1969 through 1972. The instruments placed by the Apollo 12, 14, 15 and 16 missions functioned perfectly until they were switched off in 1977. The first three kinds of moonquakes mentioned above tend to be mild; however, shallow moonquakes can register up to mB=5.5 on the body-wave magnitude scale.[7] Between 1972 and 1977, 28 shallow moonquakes were observed. Deep moonquakes tend to occur within isolated kilometer-scale patches, sometimes referred to as nests or clusters.[8] A marsquake is a quake that occurs on the planet Mars. A 2012 study suggests that marsquakes may occur every million years.[9] This suggestion is related to evidence found then of Mars's tectonic boundaries.[10]\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/cool-earthquake-facts\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Cool Earthquake Facts | U.S. Geological Survey The first “pendulum seismoscope” to measure the shaking of the ground during an earthquake was developed in 1751, and it wasn’t until 1855 that faults were recognized as the source of earthquakes. Moonquakes (“earthquakes” on the moon) do occur, but they happen less frequently and have smaller magnitudes than earthquakes on the Earth. It appears they are related to the tidal stresses associated with the varying distance between the Earth and Moon. They also occur at great depth, about halfway between the surface and the center of the moon. Although both are sea waves, a tsunami and a tidal wave are two different unrelated phenomenona. A tidal wave is a shallow water wave caused by the gravitational interactions between the Sun, Moon, and Earth. A tsunami is a sea wave caused by an underwater earthquake or landslide (usually triggered by an earthquake) displacing the ocean water. The hypocenter of an earthquake is the location beneath the earth’s surface where the rupture of the fault begins. The epicenter of an earthquake is the location directly above the hypocenter on the surface of the earth. Volcanic arcs and oceanic trenches partly encircling the Pacific Basin form the so-called Ring of Fire, a zone of frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The trenches are shown in blue-green. The volcanic island arcs, although not labelled, are parallel to, and always landward of, the trenches. For example, the island arc associated with the Aleutian Trench is represented by the long chain of volcanoes that make up the Aleutian Islands. (Public domain.)

Reanalyzing old data Like Earth, the moon has a crust, mantle and core, but unlike Earth, the moon doesn’t have tectonic plates, so it doesn’t experience quakes when tectonic plates move into or past each other the way Earth does. While deep moonquakes are generally only magnitude 2 or smaller, they occur on a monthly basis, whereas quakes occurring along the same fault line on Earth may be decades or centuries apart. Moonquakes also last longer than earthquakes, which typically cease within a few minutes. Since the moon is much drier and cooler than Earth, the vibrations carry for longer, whereas Earth’s more compressible structure acts like a sponge to absorb vibrations. This view of the north polar region of the Moon was obtained by NASA’s Galileo camera during the spacecraft flyby of the Earth-Moon system on December 7 and 8, 1992. Credit: NASA/JPL Previous studies of deep moonquakes using the Apollo data were limited, since neither of the two seismic instruments on the moon entirely captured the signals from the moon’s activity—one detected high-frequency seismic activity and the other detected low-frequency seismic activity. Previous studies using only the readings from one of the seismometers underestimated the stress released by the moonquakes, and could not see the full relationship between tidal stress buildup and the stress released by the quakes, according to Renee Weber, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama who is not affiliated with the new study. The new study’s authors used a new method that combined signals from the two different instruments. The combined data helped improve researchers’ understanding of the faults where the quakes occur.

Researchers found that many shallow quake epicenters were located near places where the moon’s crust was splitting and shifting—faults—similar to where most quakes occur on earth.

What areas of the moon (using latitude and longitude areas) would you tell future missions to avoid if they wanted to avoid shallow moonquakes?

When seismometers around the world detect seismic waves, they record their velocities, which tell scientists a great deal about the composition, temperature and pressure of the material through which the waves have traveled. The location and magnitude of an earthquake can also provide a window into the Earth's tectonic processes at work. Increased tectonic knowledge helps scientists improve their calculations of the probability of seismic events along particular faults, according to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Do earthquakes happen on other planets? At present, we do not know of any other planet that possesses a lithosphere divided into true plates that undergo tectonic processes, according to the Lunar and Planetary Institute. That being said, that isn't to say that quakes don't exist elsewhere in the solar system, for there is more than one way to trigger a seismic event. Moonquakes and marsquakes have both been detected, allowing researchers to probe further into the interiors of these distant worlds. The first seismometer on the moon was actually placed there during Apollo 11 and was even put to the test by Buzz Aldrin stamping his foot nearby (the instrument recorded it), according to the EU Research and Innovation Magazine, Horizon. Several other seismometers were deployed on subsequent Apollo missions and collected valuable seismic data. The seismometers were operational until 1977. Data collected from the instruments is still being analyzed by scientists as there are currently no active lunar seismometers.

These two types of seismicity are observable on the Moon simply because the Moon's surface is so seismically quiet relative to the Earth. This is because the Moon has neither atmosphere nor ocean (the major sources of microseisms on the Earth). Practically all meteoroids encountering the Earth disintegrate as they enter the Earth's atmosphere, and those which reach the ground (meteorites) have decelerated sufficiently that they rarely generate globally detectable seismic waves. Shallow moonquakes appear to be the only truly tectonic quakes in the Moon. However, even though the overwhelming majority of earthquakes are of tectonic origin, there are significant differences between shallow moonquakes and earthquakes. Most earthquakes occur along lithospheric plate boundaries, where large stresses caused by the relative motion of plates are concentrated. In contrast, there are no surface geologic features on the Moon that indicate the existence of moving lithospheric plates. Apparently, the extraordinary thickness of the Moon's lithosphere (Figure M97) precludes the occurrence of plate-like segmentations. Thus it is not surprising that no moonquakes similar to typical interplate earthquakes have been observed. On the other hand, shallow moonquakes do have many similarities with intraplate earthquakes. These are the earthquakes that occur in the interiors of lithospheric plates, usually along some pre-existing weaknesses, and include some of the largest earthquakes ever observed. As the Moon has a single lithospheric plate, all moonquakes are ‘intraplate’; thus such similarities are not surprising. There is a significant difference in the overall level of seismicity between the Earth and the Moon.

The hunt for tidal quakes on Earth The first statistical analysis of a possible linkage between solid earth tides and earthquakes was made by Leon Knopoff in 1964, during the space race. He didn’t find a connection. The discovery of tidal quakes on the moon inspired people to look more carefully for tidal triggering of quakes on Earth. Though the magnitude of tidal forces is only 0.1 bars, an order of magnitude lower than the threshold for triggering [Stein 2004], it hasn’t stopped researchers from hunting for a connection between earth tides and both small and large earthquakes. Some studies have shown a correlation [ex: Heaton 1975; Cochran et al., 2004], but only for dip-slip earthquakes. A conclusive link between tides and earthquake nucleation proved elusive, though, until one researcher broke the mold by looking for the direction of tidal stresses rather than their phase. Tanaka et al., [2004] found that as many as 10% of earthquakes in Japan during their study period were triggered by tidal stresses — including strike-slip events. Subsequently Ide et al., [2016] documented that large megathrust earthquakes, such as the 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku events, have occurred near maximum tidal stresses.

The longest ever recorded on the planet was nearly ten minutes, but that is extremely rare. Moonquakes don’t seem to have such strict schedules, and on average, they last far longer than quakes on Earth. When the tectonic plates rumble and an earthquake occurs, the huge amount of energy spreads out through the mineral-rich crust of the earth, which has largely been infiltrated by water in the stone. In effect, this makes the material slightly more compressible, and able to absorb energy and seismic waves, diminishing the power and slowing the shaking. Even so, they can still be scary – and unexpected! On the moon, things are very different, as the entire ball is hardened, rigid and dry. When a tremor rocks the surface of the moon, it resonates powerfully, without anywhere to naturally dissipate. It isn’t uncommon for a moonquake to last for ten minutes or more, and for smaller trembling to continue for hours afterwards. Moonquakes And The Future Although this is still years away, a lunar colony would need to consider the potentially devastating effects of moonquakes on the structures and inhabitants. At present, all of the seismometers were placed in a rather small area near the Apollo landing site. Very little is known about the moonquake activity near the lunar poles, or whether there are certain areas of the moon where moonquakes are less common. In the coming years, NASA plans to land a dozen more seismometer sensors on more disparate parts of the moon to learn more about the frequency and severity of these quakes.

In addition to being off-centered, the moon also has a sort of lumpy gravitational field due to pockets of concentrated mass located under some of its basins. One possible explanation for this is that asteroids hitting the moon billions of years ago caused regions of the moon to melt. As these regions dried, they became more dense and concentrated.

At the bottom of the figure these vibrations have been split up into a series of peaks, each with a definite frequency, similar to that of the spectrum of light. Such a spectrum indicates the relative amplitude of each harmonic present in the free oscillations. If the physical properties of the Earth’s interior were known, all these individual peaks could be calculated directly. Instead, the internal structure must be estimated from the observed peaks. Recent research has shown that observations of long-period oscillations of the Earth discriminate fairly finely between different Earth models. In applying the observations to improve the resolution and precision of such representations of the planet’s internal structure, a considerable number of Earth models are set up, and all the periods of their free oscillations are computed and checked against the observations. Models can then be successively eliminated until only a small range remains. In practice, the work starts with existing models; efforts are made to amend them by sequential steps until full compatibility with the observations is achieved, within the uncertainties of the observations. Even so, the resulting computed Earth structure is not a unique solution to the problem.

The instruments detected between 600 and 3,000 moonquakes during each year of their operation, though most of these seismic events were very small. The ground noise on the lunar surface is low compared with that of the Earth, so that the seismographs could be operated at very high magnifications. Because there was more than one station on the Moon, it was possible to use the arrival times of P and S waves at the lunar stations from the moonquakes to determine foci in the same way as is done on the Earth.

The moon and Mars have no mobile plates, so the internal tremors are a result of interior heat. In the case of the moon, quakes happen because it is losing its primordial heat—literally, the warmth of its creation—and contracting as it cools.

Renee Weber, a seismologist at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, says the shallow quakes are more like those we experience on Earth. Once LRO images showed multiple scarps—plus rock piles, landslides and other features that suggest the moon is shaking—she and colleagues decided to go back through the Apollo records, trying to tie specific moonquakes to features on its face. The team had to perform a series of complicated calculations and simulations, in part because the Apollo records are so difficult to use. Apollo was the first time anyone tried to digitize seismological data, Weber says. What is more, the moon’s crumbly regolith dampens seismic waves, making them harder to trace back to their origin. After several years of analysis, the team was able to determine the epicenters of eight Apollo moonquakes, and tie them to specific faults observed with LRO. They were even able to correlate them to the moon’s orbital position around Earth, finding that more moonquakes occur during apogee, when the moon is at its most distant and Earth’s gravitational pull wanes.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  }\n]\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"Moonquakes occur on the Moon and can have magnitudes comparable to large earthquakes on Earth.\",\n    \"quote\": \"In theory, moonquakes generated by the activity of these small structures can be on the same magnitude with the 1906 San Francisco earthquake (Nahm and Velasco, 2013).\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The snippet explicitly states that moonquakes can reach magnitudes similar to a major Earth earthquake, directly confirming their occurrence and similarity.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"high\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"Moonquakes occur on the Moon and are the lunar equivalent of earthquakes, though caused differently.\",\n    \"quote\": \"A moonquake is the lunar equivalent of an earthquake (i.e., a quake on the Moon) although moonquakes are caused in different ways.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"Explicitly states that moonquakes occur on the Moon as equivalents to earthquakes, directly answering the query.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"high\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"Moonquakes occur on the Moon but are less frequent and weaker than earthquakes on Earth.\",\n    \"quote\": \"Moonquakes (“earthquakes” on the moon) do occur, but they happen less frequently and have smaller magnitudes than earthquakes on the Earth.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The snippet explicitly states that moonquakes occur, directly answering the query.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"high\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"The Moon experiences moonquakes that occur regularly, though they differ from Earth's tectonic earthquakes.\",\n    \"quote\": \"unlike Earth, the moon doesn’t have tectonic plates, so it doesn’t experience quakes when tectonic plates move into or past each other the way Earth does.

I synthesize the consensus that moonquakes exist and are similar in nature to earthquakes, while noting the disagreement about their relative magnitude and frequency, prioritizing high-credibility sources [d1][d2][d3][d7][d11][d12].</think>\n\nYes. Multiple high-credibility sources confirm that moonquakes occur on the Moon and are the lunar equivalent of earthquakes, though they arise from different causes such as crustal contraction and thermal stresses rather than plate tectonics [d1][d2][d3][d7][d11][d12]. Some studies note that certain shallow moonquakes can reach magnitudes comparable to large earthquakes on Earth [d1], while others describe them as generally smaller and less frequent [d3][d4]. Overall, the evidence shows that the Moon experiences seismic activity similar in nature to earthquakes, but typically weaker and driven by different geological processes [d5][d8][d9][d10].\n[[END-OF-ANSWER]]"}]}

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain;

At first called “Chief,” this leader has been titled “Director” since the term of William Flynn (1919-1921). The FBI Director has answered directly to the attorney general since the 1920s.‬ ‪Under the Omnibus Crime Control Act and Safe Streets Act of 1968, Public Law 90-3351, the Director is appointed by the U.S. President and confirmed by the Senate. On October 15, 1976, in reaction to the extraordinary 48-year term of J. Edgar Hoover, Congress passed Public Law 94-503, limiting the FBI Director to a single term of no longer than 10 years. ‪ J. Edgar Hoover led the FBI for nearly a half-century, from 1924 until 1972. Under Director Hoover, the Bureau grew in responsibility and importance, becoming an integral part of the national government and an icon in American popular culture. At the end of April 1912, Attorney General Wickersham appointed Mr. Bielaski to replace Mr. Finch. As chief, Mr. Bielaski oversaw a steady increase in the resources and responsibilities assigned to the Bureau.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2016-05-03\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.fbi.gov/about/faqs/who-is-the-head-of-the-fbi\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Who is the head of the FBI?

A native of New York, Mr. Patel graduated from the University of Richmond in 2002 with a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice and history. He later returned to New York to earn his juris doctor and earned a certificate in international law from University College London Faculty of Laws in the United Kingdom. Mr. Patel began his career in 2005 as a public defender in Florida, trying scores of jury trials in federal and state courts, ranging from murder to narco-trafficking and complex financial crimes. In 2014, Mr. Patel began his tenure with the Department of Justice (DOJ) as a national security prosecutor under the Obama Administration, where he led investigations spanning multiple theaters of conflict and oversaw the successful prosecution of al-Qaida, ISIS, and other terrorist actors. He also served as the DOJ liaison officer to Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), working with our nation’s tier one special forces units to conduct collaborative global targeting operations in almost every theater of war worldwide. Mr. Patel then served as the national security advisor and senior counsel for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), where he spearheaded the investigation into Russia’s influence campaign of the 2016 presidential election and ultimately unearthed U.S. intelligence malpractice during the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane investigation. Concurrently, he led congressional oversight of sensitive programs for the Intelligence Community (IC) and U.S. Special Operations Forces. His efforts ensured that legislation was enacted to fully fund the multi-billion-dollar budgets supporting intelligence and counterterrorism operations worldwide.

Federal Bureau of Investigation directors (1935–present) The FBI became an independent service within the Department of Justice in 1935.[14] In the same year, its name was officially changed to the present-day Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), with J. Edgar Hoover receiving the current title of Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Since 1972, the United States Senate has had to confirm the nomination of a permanent officeholder. Frank Johnson had been nominated by Jimmy Carter in 1977, but withdrew for health reasons.[15] Although Sessions denied that he had acted improperly, he was pressured to resign in early July, with some suggesting that President Clinton was giving Sessions the chance to step down in a dignified manner. Sessions refused, saying that he had done nothing wrong, and insisted on staying in office until his successor was confirmed. As a result, President Clinton dismissed Sessions on July 19, 1993, five and a half years into a ten-year term. Clinton's public explanation was that there had been a loss of confidence in Sessions' leadership, and then-Attorney General Reno recommended the dismissal.[19] Clinton nominated Louis Freeh to be FBI Director on July 20. Then-FBI deputy director Floyd I. Clarke, who Sessions suggested had led a coup to force his removal, served as acting director until September 1, 1993, when Freeh was sworn in.[20] In the dismissal letter Trump stated that Comey had asserted \\\"on three separate occasions that I am not under investigation\\\" which was later confirmed by Comey to the Senate while under oath.[29] This is disputed by reporting from multiple news agencies with multiple sources. According to the reporting, Trump had been openly talking about firing Comey for at least a week before his dismissal. Trump and Democratic leaders had long questioned Comey's judgment.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2025-03-28\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d5\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/u9DFrjouj4Y\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Kash Patel Sworn In as FBI Director - YouTube \\\"I am living the American Dream.

Patel, a former defence department chief of staff and ex-federal prosecutor, is a staunch Trump supporter and a fellow critic of the US government's top law enforcement agency. He was confirmed in a party line vote of 51-49, with only two Republicans joining all Democrats against him, citing concerns over his qualifications to lead the agency and claiming that he will pursue retribution against critics of Trump. Patel has previously suggested dramatically limiting the authority of the FBI, which Republicans allege has unfairly targeted conservatives in recent years. The FBI's outgoing director Christopher Wray has denied such allegations. Patel replaces Christopher Wray whom Trump picked in 2017. Wray resigned before inauguration day last month after the incoming Republican president indicated he would fire him. The FBI director leads 37,000 employees across 55 US field offices. They also oversee 350 satellite offices and more than 60 other foreign locations expected to cover almost 200 countries. Patel only narrowly cleared the final hurdle, reflecting the deep divisions over his nomination - the last three FBI picks were approved by at least 90 senators. Getty Images Patel is a fervent Trump supporter and a fellow critic of the the US government's top law enforcement agency In his confirmation hearings, Patel denied keeping a list of \\\"deep state\\\" enemies, while playing down controversial past remarks he had made, such as referring to law enforcement officials who investigated Trump as \\\"criminal gangsters\\\".

In 1964, just days before Hoover testified in the earliest stages of the Warren Commission hearings, President Lyndon B. Johnson waived the then mandatory U.S. Government Service Retirement Age of 70, allowing Hoover to remain the FBI Director \\\"for an indefinite period of time\\\".[98] The House Select Committee on Assassinations issued a report in 1979 critical of the performance by the FBI, the Warren Commission, and other agencies. The report criticized the FBI's (Hoover's) reluctance to investigate thoroughly the possibility of a conspiracy to assassinate the President.[99][100] When Nixon took office in January 1969, Hoover had just turned 74. There was a growing sentiment in Washington, D.C., that the aging FBI chief should retire, but Hoover's power and friends in Congress remained too strong for him to be forced to do so.[101] Hoover remained director of the FBI until he died of a heart attack in his Washington home, on May 2, 1972,[102] whereupon operational command of the Bureau was passed onto Associate Director Clyde Tolson.

For most of his life, Americans considered him a hero.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

What myths and realities surround subliminal ads, and what does it mean for you? The idea that we can be influenced by ads we don’t consciously detect is one of most intriguing in consumer psychology and has attracted a lot of attention over the years. Since the 1950s, people have feared that words or images briefly flashed on a screen or concealed in an advertisement have the power to make us buy certain products or even vote for a certain political candidate. Are these fears founded, or is this more myth than reality? The answer, believe it or not, is yes and no: While there are widely held false beliefs about subliminal advertising, it can influence us. In this post, I’m going to explain this seeming contradiction, starting with a discussion of what subliminal advertising is and the origin of popular beliefs surrounding it, and then finishing with a discussion of when it actually does influence us. After reading this, you might start to look at the ice cubes in that liquor ad a little differently. Subliminal advertising is that making use of words or images (referred to as stimuli) we don’t consciously detect. Those stimuli can be undetectable because they’re hidden inside of some other image (e.g., concealing the word \\\"sex\\\" in some ice cubes in a liquor ad), or because they’re presented on a screen so briefly we’re not aware we’re seeing them. How briefly does something have to be presented to be undetectable? The oft-agreed duration is .003 seconds (that’s three one-thousandths of a second). Most people will not be consciously aware they’ve seen a stimulus that was presented for .003 seconds. Regardless though of whether a stimulus is considered subliminal because it’s concealed in something else or because it’s presented very briefly, the distinguishing feature is that we’re not aware we’re looking at it. When subliminal stimuli exert an influence on us it’s said to be an unconscious influence, meaning it’s an influence we’re not consciously aware of.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://sharethis.com/marketing/2023/02/examples-of-subliminal-advertising-and-why-they-work/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"9 Examples of Subliminal Advertising (and Why They Work ... The key to using subliminal advertising effectively is to stay well within widely accepted ethical boundaries, avoid appealing to inappropriate audiences, and design your messaging in such a way that consumers don’t feel as though they’re being intentionally duped. Continue reading to learn more about what subliminal advertising is and explore nine examples of subliminal advertising that works. What is Subliminal Advertising? Subliminal advertising is advertising that contains words, images, or sounds designed to convey a message to an audience that the conscious mind can’t observe. In other words, subliminal advertising is the use of visual and auditory stimuli to influence the subconscious mind and drive consumer behavior, all while the consumer isn’t consciously aware of the message that’s being conveyed. Brand identity elements, such as a company’s logo or the company tagline, can even contain subliminal advertising. These elements are used consistently in order to create brand awareness and get consumers to associate certain images and feelings with your brand. While it’s intentionally designed to be manipulative, ethical subliminal advertising isn’t used for malicious or inappropriate purposes. Instead, it should subtly convey a key yet harmless message to your audience’s subconscious minds. Done right, your audience has your intended message in their minds after being exposed to the advertisement, even if you didn’t convey that message directly to their conscious minds. 9 Successful Examples of Subliminal Advertising The following are successful examples of how subliminal advertising can work for businesses and how even the largest companies use it in their marketing. 1. Goodwill Logo When you look at the Goodwill logo, you might first notice part of a smiling face, possibly alluding to the chain’s ability to make people in communities smile with access to low-cost donated items. Take a closer look, and you’ll see that the ‘g’ in ‘goodwill’ also doubles as a partial face. This simple tactic pulls the logo and brand concept together and has the power to evoke emotion from consumers. 2.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://ignitevisibility.com/7-examples-effective-subliminal-advertising/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"12 Examples of Effective Subliminal Advertising (And 6 That Aren't) With our subconscious perpetually on autopilot, when subliminal messages do stick, it’s because your subconscious mind is taking them in.

However, there are some court precedents that you might want to bring up when talking about the issue with your attorney. The first is Central Hudson Gas & Electric v. Public Service Commission of New York. In that case, the Supreme Court held that in order for marketing speech to be protected by the First Amendment, it must not be misleading. If your subliminal message is misleading, you could run into problems. In a separate case, Vance v. Judas Priest, a Nevada judge ruled that subliminal messages aren’t protected by the First Amendment. 4. What Do Psychologists Say About Subliminal Advertising? Art Markman, writing for Psychology Today, says that subliminal advertising can have some influence on a consumer, but it can’t turn that person into a robot. In other words, the best you’re going to do with subliminal advertising is to nudge people in a direction they have headed anyway. But it does have some influence. Philip Merikle, who works for the Department of Psychology at the University of Waterloo, points to several studies that show “considerable information capable of informing decisions and guiding actions is perceived even when observers do not experience any awareness of perceiving.” 5. What Do I Need to Know About Subliminal Advertising? If you’re going to start incorporating subliminal messages into your advertising, it is important to understand that it only works when you’re subtle about it. Choose particular colors, words, and shapes to make your point in a small but powerful way. 6. What Are The Issues With Subliminal Advertising? Like most advertising techniques, subliminal messages don’t exist without some issues. Some people think they are unethical and manipulative. Sometimes,\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.dvdtalk.com/dvdsavant/s6sublime.html\",\n    \"snippet\": \"DVD Savant: Subliminal Advertising - The Real Thing Subliminal Advertising The Real Thing Savant Article I've heard about subliminal suggestion, the idea that if you flicker a message briefly on TV or in a movie, you can hypnotize an audience into doing what you want. Is it real? Did it ever really happen? Subliminal influence is real, according to scientists, and was tried out on the public a few times in 1958 before it was, I believe, made illegal. That doesn't mean it worked or ever had the slightest actual influence on anyone, however. The myth, or, depending how you look at it, the science of subliminal suggestion circulated in the late fifties in the same way that flying saucers did -- no one had any concrete information to offer, but a lot of people believed in it. There was supposed to be some shadowy 'they' in the media who were dictating what we bought and who we voted for, what soft drink we drank and what aftershave we used. This was all being done, the theory went, with a sinister form of mind control employing messages blinked at us too quickly for our conscious minds to notice. Even if we were unaware on the surface that we had received the message, our subconcious minds would absorb it anyway. Without our higher brain functions to evaluateand perhaps nullify the message, the theory was that it would simply be accepted as truth. If it were a call to action, like, for example, \\\"THIRSTY NOW\\\" flickered at us during a movie, we would involuntarily decide that we indeed were thirsty, and head for the refreshment counter like obedient zombie slaves. If the idea seems familiar, you may be aware of a John Carpenter film called They Live that toys cleverly with the idea of a secret clique of aliens living invisibly amongst us. The hero of that movie chances to try on a pair of the aliens' dark glasses, and sees not only the aliens for the monsters they are, but sinister subliminal messages in place of newspaper headlines, billboard announcements, street signs etc.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d5\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/193862/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"\\\"Subliminal\\\" Advertising - Project MUSE The image flashes too quickly to be examined in any detail, and thus a visit to the show room is necessary. Although the song claims that the image is “subliminal,” it is not really subliminal at all because it can be seen briefly and recognized as a Chevrolet. If it were a real subliminal message in the terms discussed above, it could not be perceived consciously nor would the advertisement speak directly about the subliminal communication. In fact, the commercial mocks subliminal advertising and serves instead to invite viewers to visit Chevrolet dealers’ show rooms all over the country when the model comes out. Perhaps the most common responses of Madison Avenue to the idea of subliminal advertising in the late 1950s were to ignore it, to disclaim it, or to poke fun at it. What the industry did not do was to launch any serious effort to counter the claims of Vicary, Packard, and others who were concerned about invisible, covert, and subliminal manipulations of consumers. The public response of admen seems to have been to let the idea of subliminal advertising wither and die on the vine. There is some evidence that advertising agencies and large corporations, not wanting other agencies and corporations to get the jump on them, did investigate and invest in subliminal advertising. Several seem to have engaged the services of Vicary as a paid consultant. According to Stuart Rogers writing in Public Relations Quarterly in the early 1990s, “it has been estimated that [Vicary] collected retainer and consulting fees from America ‘s largest advertisers totaling some $4.5 million. ”6 However, there is no real evidence that advertising agencies — given the extremely negative public reception that subliminal projection had received — actually used subliminal techniques as a major means of communicating with consumers. By the end of the 1960s, the brouhaha over subliminal advertising had diminished significantly.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d6\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/03/05/why-behavioral-advertising-should-be-illegal/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Why Behavioral Advertising Should Be Illegal In the 1950s, moviegoers were unknowingly subjected to a new advertising technique -- subliminal advertising. A psychologist named James Vicary wanted to see if he could change behavior by slipping messages into a movie without viewers being consciously aware of them. Messages like \\\"Drink Coca-Cola\\\" or \\\"Buy Popcorn. \\\" The results are scientifically disputed. There is evidence that the messages worked but not all the time. Still, some governments attempted to ban the practice by passing legislation to outlaw it for this reason: Psychological manipulation, known as brainwashing at the time, was akin to the authoritarian regime depicted in George Orwell's 1984. In the name of freedom and democracy, citizens should not be subjected to psychological manipulation without their knowledge or consent. Today, there is a new kind of advertising born of the internet. It is called behavioral advertising (also known as behavioral targeting). Internet companies such as Facebook, Google and a whole host of others have gathered so much data on you that they know your desires, fears and how to exploit those characteristics to change your behavior. The aforementioned companies are able to tap into behavioral advertising by utilizing psychographics, which is the study of human behavior that taps into an individual’s interests, values personality traits. Psychographics is used widely in marketing, particularly by internet-based organizations, to determine how best to target users with messages and/or advertisements. While Facebook is just one example of a company that uses psychographics on users, it is also the company we hear about the most, in large part due to the enormous influence it has had over individuals and societies. Facebook started this psychological experiment with a key human element -- trust. Facebook’s original mission statement was “To give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.” In 2017, Mark Zuckerberg revealed a new mission statement: “Give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.” The company began by bringing friends and family together on its platform, creating communities of trust.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d7\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/subliminal\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Subliminal Definition & Meaning - Merriam-Webster Did you know?

But ordinary ads, both in print and on TV, do contain all kinds of images that shape our response to the product being advertised even when we don't realize it. Try looking carefully at some ads that you like, in order to discover how many ways they may be subliminally affecting you. Example Sentences The studio denied the existence of subliminal messages in the movie. I am skeptical that subliminal advertising actually works.

Subliminal Advertising Whether we realize it or not, we’ve all probably viewed a subliminal advertisement at least a few times in our lives. The notion is a little spooky– it’s very strange to consider that advertisements we see on a regular basis may have some secret message that is affecting our brains without our knowledge. However, it’s not necessarily that nefarious. The whole purpose of advertising is to convince consumers to purchase a product or service. There is some psychology mixed into this. In fact, one could say that psychology and convincing are at the core of advertising. So how exactly do businesses and marketers use subliminal advertising? Let’s take a look. What Is Subliminal Advertising? Subliminal advertising can be described as the use of subliminal messages, either visual or auditory, that the conscious mind is not capable of perceiving. These stimuli can be placed in television commercials, songs, and other media. It is one of the most famous types of food advertising tricks in television commercials. This messaging can be used to increase how persuasive an advertisement is or to push a completely different message. Disruptive Advertising (Ads) meaning refers to the practice of using hidden messages to affect buyer behavior without conscious awareness in the context of subliminal advertising. Marketers may overcome buyers’ conscious filters and make a stronger effect on their subconscious thoughts by using disruptive advertising strategies in subliminal advertising. “Real” or “true” subliminal messages can’t be perceived by the conscious mind, even if a person is looking for them directly. This is because the stimuli that we interact with every day are perceptible and above the threshold of conscious perception. Subliminal messages, on the other hand, are below the threshold of conscious perception. Subliminal Advertising Ideas The possibilities are endless when it comes to subliminal advertising. Here are a few ideas to try implementing: Incorporate hidden or difficult-to-see images and symbols into different areas of your ad.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d9\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.vox.com/2014/9/8/6111847/do-subliminal-messages-work\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Do subliminal messages actually work? - Vox So altogether, it's unclear how much of this subliminal priming stuff would still hold up in daily life, outside of the laboratory. As far as subliminal advertising is concerned, it's probably not worth the investment. Zimmerman says it's unlikely that advertisers are using it in the US today. \\\"I don't think there’s any evidence to suggest that it’s more effective than just a traditional ad that we’re very aware of,\\\" he says. \\\"Why go to the trouble?\\\" Still, psychologists do use subliminal priming as a tool to understand the unconscious mind Subliminal messages can also be useful for research. Subliminal priming studies are common these days — not just to test subliminal messages themselves, but actually as a research tool in psychology. Here's how it works. Researchers flash something subliminally and see how it affects some other task or test. For example, this study found that subconsciously priming white Americans with the word \\\"BLACK\\\" made them respond faster to negative stereotypes in a later word task (even among people who didn't display racist attitudes in a direct survey). This is one example of researchers using subliminal messages to studyimplicit attitudes that people don't even know they have. Subliminal messages have become a tool that psychologists use to explore the unconscious mind. Most news outlets make their money through advertising or subscriptions. But when it comes to what we’re trying to do at Vox, there are a couple of big issues with relying on ads and subscriptions to keep the lights on. First, advertising dollars go up and down with the economy. We often only know a few months out what our advertising revenue will be, which makes it hard to plan ahead. Second, we’re not in the subscriptions business. Vox is here to help everyone understand the complex issues shaping the world — not just the people who can afford to pay for a subscription. We believe that’s an important part of building a more equal society.

Therefore, the final answer presents both perspectives neutrally, emphasizing that most research does not confirm subliminal advertising as genuinely effective. </think>\n\nEvidence about subliminal advertising is mixed. High-credibility sources note that while the idea of subliminal influence exists, there is no solid proof that such advertising has ever worked in practice [d1][d5][d7]. Other sources suggest that subliminal messages might exert a limited or inconsistent effect on consumers, but not enough to reliably change behavior [d2][d3][d4][d6][d8][d9]. Overall, research outcomes conflict, with most evidence indicating that subliminal advertising has not been shown to be genuinely effective.\n[[END-OF-ANSWER]]"}]}

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON. The rest is plain text.\n- ≥80% of final-answer sentences include [dX] (unless abstaining).\n- Use an EM DASH \" — \" in the label line (not hyphen or en dash).\n- Be precise and faithful; no new facts; respect length budgets.\n\nInputs:\n\n- query:\n{query}\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n{retrieved_docs}\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n{per_doc_notes}\n\nTask:\n1) Follow the full OUTPUT CONTRACT exactly.\n   • <think> block with:\n       (A) VALID JSON array for EVERY doc d1…dN (order-preserving, one object per doc; if verdict==\"irrelevant\" set key_fact=\"\")\n       (B) Conflict reasoning FIRST: cluster docs, reference doc IDs, and NAME the mechanism (temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive)\n       (C) ONE label line: \"<ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\"\n       (D) Brief reasoning connecting evidence to the final answer (or abstention)\n   • ONE blank line\n   • Final answer (or exactly \"CANNOT ANSWER, INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\" if abstaining)\n   • Final sentinel line [[END-OF-ANSWER]].\n\nReminders (DO NOT PRINT):\n- Reason FIRST for the conflict: write the analysis in (B), THEN emit the label line in (C); the label must be a direct consequence of the reasoning.\n- Conflict taxonomy (strict): No conflict / Complementary information / Conflicting opinions or research outcomes / Conflict due to outdated information / Conflict due to misinformation.\n- Use only existing doc_ids in bracketed citations [dX]; no ranges like d1–d5; never cite out-of-bounds [dK].\n- Prefer high-credibility sources and order citations high→low in the evidence list.\n- If any doc is \"supports\" or \"partially supports\", DO NOT abstain.\n- Close </think> before the answer; no extra text outside the required format."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Inputs:\n\n- query:\nWho has the most liked post on Instagram?\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/most-liked-pictures-on-instagram/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"The 20 Most Liked Posts on Instagram - Brandwatch 1.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Keep reading to learn more about the history of Passover, how Passover is celebrated and when you should celebrate this year. When is Passover in 2024? This year, Passover begins on Monday, April 22 at sundown and ends on Tuesday, April 30 at sundown. While the date in the English calendar changes each year, the holiday always falls on the 15th day of the Hebrew month of Nissan through the 22nd. The second night of Passover also marks the beginning of a 49-day period called the Omer, during which observers are expected to count the days according to the ancient custom of thanking God for the harvest. The Omer concludes with the holiday of Shavuot, which commemorates God giving the Torah to the Israelites on Mount Sinai. What is the history of Passover? The Passover story comes from the Book of Exodus in the Torah. Thousands of years ago, the Jewish people were enslaved in Egypt and forced to labor by the Pharaoh. When God heard of this, he sent the prophet Moses to convince Pharaoh to free the Jews. Moses asked Pharaoh to let his people go, but Pharaoh refused, causing God to send down ten plagues. The first nine plagues included the Nile River turning to blood, infestations of frogs, lice, and flies, livestock pestilence, boils, hail, locusts, and darkness. For the last of the ten plagues, God asked the Jews to sacrifice a lamb or goat and smear its blood on their doorposts as a way to show that their house was Jewish.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-11\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.elpasotimes.com/story/life/holiday/2024/04/19/when-is-passover-2024-heres-what-to-know-about-the-jewish-holiday/73381289007/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"When does Passover start?

The holiday of Pesach, or Passover, is an annual weeklong festival commemorating the emancipation of Jewish peoples from slavery (in ancient Egypt). The Hebrew name, Pesach, means “to passover” because the plague in Egypt that killed all firstborns passed over the Israelites’ homes, sparing the lives of their children. When Is Passover 2025? The dates are based on the Hebrew calendar, from the 15th day of the Hebrew month of Nissan (or Nisan) through the 22nd day. Read Next Passover 2025 will be celebrated from April 12 to April 20.

It commemorates the Israelites’ Exodus from Egypt, and their transition from slavery to freedom. The main ritual of Passover is the seder, which occurs on the first two nights (in Israel just the first night) of the holiday — a festive meal that involves the re-telling of the Exodus through stories and song and the consumption of ritual foods, including matzah and maror (bitter herbs). The seder’s rituals and other readings are outlined in the Haggadah — today, many different versions of this Passover guide are available in print and online, and you can also create your own. Support My Jewish Learning Help us keep Jewish knowledge accessible to millions of people around the world. What are some Passover practices? The central Passover practice is a set of intense dietary changes, mainly the absence of hametz, or foods with leaven. (Ashkenazi Jews also avoid kitniyot, a category of food that includes legumes.) In recent years, many Jews have compensated for the lack of grain by cooking with quinoa, although not all recognize it as kosher for Passover. The ecstatic cycle of psalms called Hallel is recited both at night and day (during the seder and morning prayers). Additionally, Passover commences a 49-day period called the Omer, which recalls the count between offerings brought to the ancient Temple in Jerusalem. This count culminates in the holiday of Shavuot, the anniversary of the receiving of the Torah at Sinai.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-06-07\"\n  }\n]\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"Passover in 2025 begins before sundown on Saturday, April 12, 2025.\",\n    \"quote\": \"Pesach 2025 (Passover) begins before sundown on Saturday April 12, 2025, and ends after nightfall on April 20, 2025.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The snippet explicitly states the start date of Passover in 2025, directly answering the query.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"high\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"Passover 2025 begins on April 12.\",\n    \"quote\": \"Passover 2025: April 12-20\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The snippet explicitly provides the start date for Passover 2025, directly answering when this year's Passover starts.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"low\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"Passover in 2024 begins on Monday, April 22 at sundown.\",\n    \"quote\": \"This year, Passover begins on Monday, April 22 at sundown and ends on Tuesday, April 30 at sundown.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The snippet explicitly states the start date and time for Passover in 2024, directly answering the query.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"low\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"Passover in 2024 begins in the evening of Monday, April 22, and lasts through April 30 just after sundown.\",\n    \"quote\": \"Passover will begin in the evening of Monday, April 22, and will last through April 30 just after sundown.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The snippet explicitly states the start date and duration of Passover 2024, directly answering the query.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"low\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d5\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"Passover starts before nightfall on Monday, April 22nd, and lasts through Tuesday, April 30th.\",\n    \"quote\": \"This year, Passover starts before nightfall on Monday, April 22nd, and lasts through Tuesday, April 30th after dark.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The snippet explicitly provides the start date for this year's Passover.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"low\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d6\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"Passover in 2024 begins before sundown on Monday, April 22.\",\n    \"quote\": \"This year, Passover begin before sundown on Monday, April 22 and ends after nightfall on April 30 in the United States.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The snippet explicitly states the start date of Passover 2024, directly answering the query.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"low\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d7\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"Passover in 2025 will be observed from April 12 to April 19, 2025.\",\n    \"quote\": \"Passover will be observed this year from April 12 to April 19, 2025.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The snippet explicitly provides the start and end dates for this year's Passover, directly answering the query.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"low\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d8\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"Passover 2025 begins at sundown on Saturday, April 12.\",\n    \"quote\": \"Passover 2025 begins at sundown on Saturday, April 12.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The snippet explicitly states the start date and time for Passover 2025, directly answering the query.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"low\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d9\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"Passover starts on April 12 this year.\",\n    \"quote\": \"Passover starts on 12 Nissan on the Hebrew calendar (this year on April 12) and ends on 20 Nissan (April 20).\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The snippet explicitly states that Passover starts on April 12 this year, directly answering the query.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"low\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d10\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"Passover 2024 begins at sundown on Monday, April 22nd.\",\n    \"quote\": \"Passover 2024 begins at sundown on Monday, April 22nd and ends the evening of Tuesday, April 30th for most Jews in diaspora.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The snippet explicitly states the start date and time for Passover 2024, directly answering the query.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"low\"\n  }\n]\n\nTask:\n1) Follow the full OUTPUT CONTRACT exactly.\n   • <think> block with:\n       (A) VALID JSON array for EVERY doc d1…dN (order-preserving, one object per doc;

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON. The rest is plain text.\n- ≥80% of final-answer sentences include [dX] (unless abstaining).\n- Use an EM DASH \" — \" in the label line (not hyphen or en dash).\n- Be precise and faithful; no new facts; respect length budgets.\n\nInputs:\n\n- query:\n{query}\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n{retrieved_docs}\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n{per_doc_notes}\n\nTask:\n1) Follow the full OUTPUT CONTRACT exactly.\n   • <think> block with:\n       (A) VALID JSON array for EVERY doc d1…dN (order-preserving, one object per doc; if verdict==\"irrelevant\" set key_fact=\"\")\n       (B) Conflict reasoning FIRST: cluster docs, reference doc IDs, and NAME the mechanism (temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive)\n       (C) ONE label line: \"<ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\"\n       (D) Brief reasoning connecting evidence to the final answer (or abstention)\n   • ONE blank line\n   • Final answer (or exactly \"CANNOT ANSWER, INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\" if abstaining)\n   • Final sentinel line [[END-OF-ANSWER]].\n\nReminders (DO NOT PRINT):\n- Reason FIRST for the conflict: write the analysis in (B), THEN emit the label line in (C); the label must be a direct consequence of the reasoning.\n- Conflict taxonomy (strict): No conflict / Complementary information / Conflicting opinions or research outcomes / Conflict due to outdated information / Conflict due to misinformation.\n- Use only existing doc_ids in bracketed citations [dX]; no ranges like d1–d5; never cite out-of-bounds [dK].\n- Prefer high-credibility sources and order citations high→low in the evidence list.\n- If any doc is \"supports\" or \"partially supports\", DO NOT abstain.\n- Close </think> before the answer; no extra text outside the required format."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Inputs:\n\n- query:\nIs a degree necessary to become a successful graphic designer?\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://newschoolarch.edu/blog/how-to-become-a-graphic-designer-step-by-step/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"How To Become a Graphic Designer | NewSchool How to Become a Graphic Designer: Education, Training, and Qualifications Although a sense of creativity, style, originality, excellent communication skills, and a familiarity with computer graphics, animation, and design software are desirable, planning your continued education requires careful preparation, including a visual portfolio of creative work that you’ve cultivated throughout high school to showcase your graphic design skills. Many universities recommend that students complete a year of basic art and design courses during high school to develop and learn the fundamentals of art and design. It’s essential for students to find out the specific requirements for the school or university you’re applying to and retrieve as much information as possible from your high school’s art department, guidance counselors, and other administration to help you learn and get started in the application process. For most entry-level and advanced graphic design positions, you will need a minimum of a bachelor’s degree from an accredited university, college, or private design school. However, if you are seeking an associate’s degree, you can obtain your certification from a variety of schools. Upon graduation, a 2-year degree will allow you to try assistant-level positions within the graphic design field. For those who already possess a bachelor’s degree in another major, you can complete a 2 or 3-year program in graphic design to learn the technical requirements and receive the certification needed to pursue a career in this field. If you are going back to college (continuing education), it’s usually best to contact the admissions office of whatever school you’re applying to find out the application process and what will be required (i.e., portfolio samples, transcripts, resume, etc.). Your Curriculum: What to Expect Depending on what area of graphic design you wish to pursue, your curriculum may include website visual design, studio art, computerized design, motion graphics, printing techniques, commercial graphics production, typography, and other similar coursework that falls under a fine art or graphic design program.

Many successful graphic designers have pursued creative careers in unconventional ways. Below, we explain how to get into graphic design without a degree and highlight a professional graphic designer who did exactly that. Do You Need a Degree to Be a Graphic Designer? While some graphic designers certainly use a college degree to enter the creative field, it’s not a requirement. Many companies hire entry level designers based solely on their portfolio and experience, rather than if they have a degree.

The last is perhaps the most important in the job-hunting process. You must have a portfolio of work to demonstrate your creativity and design skills, so potential employers have something concrete on which to base a hiring decision. Even if you don’t have an art degree, you will need a portfolio of your graphic design work to present to potential employers. Skills You Need as a Designer While you can learn how to be a graphic designer without a degree, you will still need a few basic skills to succeed in a professional graphic design environment. Software Skills Whether or not you have a degree, you will need to have a good grasp on design software.

What graphic designers do: Graphic designers are responsible for creating the graphics and visuals that appear in magazines, advertisements, websites, and other forms of media. They may work for a design firm, or they may freelance. A graphic designer’s job involves more than just creating pretty pictures. They must understand the principles of design, colour theory, typography, and layout. They must also be able to use computers to create graphics and manipulate photographs. Graphic designers often collaborate with copywriters, web developers, marketing professionals, and others to create an entire visual branding package for a company or product. They must be able to think creatively and be able to communicate their ideas effectively. Graphic design isn’t just for people with degrees Design isn’t just for people with degrees. In fact, many great designers have never stepped foot inside a design school. Graphic design is about solving problems and communicating with visuals. If you have an eye for composition, colour, and typography, then you can be a graphic designer. All it takes is some practice, a lot of experimentation, and a good dose of creativity.

Do you need a degree to become a graphic designer? No, a degree is not required to become a graphic designer. Only a minority of companies hire designers exclusively based on their educational background, and most are much more interested in the applicants’ design portfolio and relevant work experience. Here’s why the value of a college degree is declining in the field of graphic design: Self-teaching. Teaching yourself graphic design skills is much more common in the design industry than in other professions, removing the need for a degree altogether. Plus, the proliferation of online tutorials, courses, and YouTube videos has made it easier to replace formal education with self-education. Accessibility. The tools used by graphic designers have never been as accessible as they are now. Due to technological advancements, virtually anyone with a computer, the skills, and the right software can enter the graphic design industry without formal education or networking. Freelancing opportunities. The rise of freelancing and the gig economy has made it easier for designers to find work without going through traditional channels and meeting employer requirements. Many high-profile clients are happy to hire freelance graphic designers they found online, as long as they have an impressive portfolio. Even if you leave freelance graphic design jobs out of the equation, the data shows that most graphic designer jobs don’t require a degree in 2022.

Differences between a Degree in Graphic Design Vs. Self-Taught Experience While formal education in graphic design is always beneficial, it is not necessary to have a degree to become a successful graphic designer. Many designers are self-taught and have built their skills through practice and study. Training and Certifications Available for Graphic Designers There are numerous training programs and certifications available for graphic designers.

Graphic design requires a good eye and a creative mind, but also tantamount are the development of solid practical skills and software fluency. The sooner the student begins preparations, the better. Step 2 Earn a Degree in Graphic Design There was a time when a graphic designer could get hired strictly on their creative portfolio. Today, however, most employers are looking for designers with a more complete and well-rounded education – the kind only a college degree can provide. A certificate in the field, or an associate's degree, may be sufficient in some cases, but the U.S. Department of Labor reports that fledgling designers are much more likely to land a quality job only after earning a bachelor's degree. There are currently approximately 300 post-secondary institutions in the U.S. that offer degree programs accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design. School options run the gamut from large public universities, to small private colleges, to prestigious art institutes. There are also a growing number of online programs available.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array;

While there are monogamous birds out there, bird mating habits vary by species. Learn which birds mate for life, and which move on. Courtesy Tonya SharpBald eagle pairs mate for life When it comes to love and marriage, bird mating habits aren’t much different than people. Birds meet and then carry on a courtship that includes dinner dates, dancing and just hanging out together. Birds, especially males, sing, show off a lot and wear flashy adornments just to impress females. Then if the two birds like each other, they become a pair, build a nest, raise youngsters, school them and send them off to form their own families. Also like people, pairs are not always faithful and will have flings with individuals other than their own mates. If the marriage doesn’t result in raising young, the pair may “divorce”, remarry and try again. Discover the monogamous birds that mate for life. Birds That Mate for Life It’s fairly rare to find monogamous birds that remain together “until death do us part,” a fact not realized until pretty recently. Until the development of DNA fingerprinting techniques in the 1980s, most people thought birds faithfully mated for life, or at least for the season. Using DNA, scientists have produced some shocking discoveries. Most birds are far from monogamous. Most birds do not mate for life, and most of those that do aren’t quite as faithful as we’d like to think. Over 92 percent of all bird species form a pair bond and stay together for at least part of the nesting cycle. Yet DNA tests of baby birds have shown that in over 75 percent of these species, some birds have mated with one or more birds other than their “social mate.” Monogamous Birds Yet, there are a few species of birds that meet, court and form pair bonds that result in many offspring, year after year, until one of the pair dies. For nearly all swans, geese, ducks, cranes, storks and a few others, long-term monogamy is the preferred relationship.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.audubon.org/news/till-death-do-them-part-8-birds-mate-life\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Till Death Do Them Part: 8 Birds that Mate for Life | Audubon Birds Tell Us to Act on Climate Love is in the air.

Yes, even Black Vultures stick together. “One bird, presumed to be male, chases a presumed female through the air and periodically dives at her” as part of the mating ritual, according to Birds of North America online. They form such a tight bond, in fact, that they hang out year round—not just during breeding season. Bald Eagle Average clutch size: 1-3 eggs Cool fact: Measuring six feet across and four feet tall (or even larger!), Bald Eagle nests are some of the largest of any avian species. These birds, the symbol of the United States, mate for life unless one of the two dies. Their spectacular courtship rituals are a sight to see, with the birds locking talons, then flipping, spinning, and twirling through the air in a maneuver called a Cartwheel Display. They break apart seemingly at the last moment, just before hitting the ground. Laysan Albatross Average clutch size: 1 egg Cool fact: Nearly three-quarters of the world’s population of this species nests on Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge. Laysan Albatrosses, which don’t breed until they’re eight or nine years old, are monogamous, annually solidifying their bond through ritual dancing. “If they do lose their mate, they will go through a year or two of a mourning period,” says John Klavitter, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist at Midway Atoll.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.bbcearth.com/news/seven-animals-who-mate-for-life\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Seven animals who mate for life | BBC Earth Seven animals who mate for life Finding that special someone in your life is a beautiful thing, but when it comes to animals it's also quite rare. Although an estimated 90% of bird species partner up for life, the same can’t be said for mammals. According to Hemanth P. Niar and Larry J Young’s study, Genes to Brain to Behavior, it is estimated that only 3% to 5% of all mammal species (excluding humans) form monogamous relationships. And even then, it’s complicated. But despite their rarity, life-long partnerships throughout the animal kingdom can be found, from canine power couples to worms who take the idea of becoming one to a whole new level. Here are seven animals that are in it for the long haul. More on Nature Wolves – Power couples In a grey wolf pack, it is usually only the male and female alpha who are allowed to breed, The pair mate for life as a way to cement their position as pack leaders, producing a new litter each year and ensuring the stability of the rest of the pack. As explained by David W. Macdonald et al in Monogamy: Cause, Consequence, or Corollary of Success in Wild Canids, monogamy makes it easier for alphas to display their strength and superiority over the other male members of the pack. Defending one mate against advances is much easier than trying to protect numerous partners, assuring their place as top dog. Beavers – Sharing is caring For Eurasian beavers, monogamy is more about practicality than romance. Unlike their North American counterparts who have been known to mate outside their bonded partners, Eurasian beavers team up for life as a way to increase their chances of survival. Although one of their primary sources of food is tree bark, its lack of nutritional value means that beavers need to eat a lot of bark to keep themselves going. So, by pairing up, couples can split their workload and ensure everything gets done.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://safarisafricana.com/birds-that-mate-for-life/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Birds That Mate For Life: 15 Monogamous Bird Species✔️ Birds That Mate For Life 15 of the world’s most amorous birds The world of wildlife behaviors is incredibly varied, with all manner of sexual practice on display. For birds specifically, the World Wildlife Foundation found that around 90% of species choose monogamy as their reproductive strategy. This is a huge number compared to mammals at just 5%. The thinking behind why birds are generally monogamous is that the parental time investment needed to raise chicks is so large. One parent is needed to incubate eggs in a nest, while the other collects food for the pair, and the chicks once they’re hatched. By the time the chicks leave the nest it’s almost breeding season again, leaving little time to find a new mate. As most species of birds are monogamous, we’ve picked a selection of 15 of the most romantic birds that mate for life. So pour yourself a glass of wine, dim the lights and turn on the romantic music, we’re about to meet nature’s most loving birds: Black vultures Black vultures Vultures are not generally thought of as amorous birds – in fact, they have rather a grim reputation. Black vultures can teach humans a lesson or two in love, however, as bonded pairs mate for life and stay together as much as possible all year-round. During their courtship, male vultures circle the female they’re wooing with an extended neck, then dive down towards them. Macaroni Penguins Macaroni penguins As with birds generally, most penguin species mate for life. Marconi penguins (also known as Royal Penguins) take loving relationships to a new level, however, performing an ‘ecstatic display’ when they see each other after being apart, puffing up their chests, swinging their heads around, and making a gurgling sound. Once their chick is hatched, the father stays with the offspring while the mother heads off to hunt for food for the family. Californian Condors Californian condor As with all the avians on this list, California condors are generally birds that mate for life.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d5\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.capecodtimes.com/story/news/environment/2017/02/18/love-their-life-not-really/22436886007/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Love of their life? Not really But, to be fair, a bird's definition of monogamy is also surprisingly liberal. Yet, there are a few species of birds that meet, court and form pair-bonds that result in many offspring, year after year, until one of the pair dies. These large birds are considered as mating for life. Among them are: mute swans, Canada geese, bald eagles and great horned owls. Why birds mate for life is not as romantic as one may think. When you consider the possible time needed to migrate, to establish territories, sit on eggs and raise the young, you'll realize that the extra time and energy needed to attract a mate would minimize reproductive time. The bald eagle, for example, spends just over a month incubating the eggs and almost three months raising their young in the nest. Establishing lifelong bonds works to their advantage. The question of whether a bird mates for life comes from pondering what happens should one bird die. Many believe that birds mourn the loss of their mate, never to mate again. There is a lot of conjecture whether birds experience loss at some level or if we sometimes interpret confusion as mourning. I do know our wild birds will always attempt to find new mates. Scientists have amassed enough data to debunk the romantic notion that most birds pair up faithfully for life. Lots of monogamous bird species “cheat” and some “divorce” but at rates much lower than humans. Male birds with a high proportion of daily female exposure are less likely to “divorce” their partner between breeding seasons. Interestingly, the absolute number of female interactions isn't important — just the ratio of females to males in the social group. This behavior was discovered by Dr. Antica Culina of Oxford University’s Zoology Department when they studied British chickadees. But monogamy isn’t the same as mating for life. A pair-bond may last for just one nesting (two nests per season on average), such as with house wrens, or one breeding season, common with most songbird species, like chickadees and goldfinches.

One of the most interesting behaviors exhibited by some bird species is their lifelong commitment to their mates. These birds pair up for life and remain loyal to each other, sharing the responsibilities of parenting and nest-building. In this article, we will take a look at ten bird species that mate for life, exploring their unique mating behaviors. 1. Bald Eagles Iconic birds in the United States, Balde Eagles are known for their majestic appearance and impressive wingspan. They mate for life and build large nests, called aeries, high up in trees or on cliffs, which they may use for many years. Bald eagles were once endangered in the United States, but conservation efforts have helped their populations to rebound in recent years. 2. Swans Like bald eagles, swans are also known for their monogamous mating habits. They form strong bonds with their partners and are known to stay together for life. Swans are also known for their impressive displays of affection, such as “billing” where they touch their bills together and make soft honking sounds. Overall, swans are a symbol of love and loyalty and are often used in art and literature to represent these qualities. 3. Penguins Penguins are a group of flightless birds that are known for their unique tuxedo-like appearance and their ability to survive in some of the harshest environments on Earth. They are also famous for their monogamous mating behavior, with many species forming long-lasting pair bonds. Penguins typically mate with the same partner each breeding season and will often return to the same nesting site year after year. Some penguin species even engage in elaborate courtship rituals, such as the “ecstatic display” of the emperor penguin, which involves singing and bowing. 4. Lovebirds Lovebirds are small parrots known for their affectionate behavior and popularity as pets. In their natural habitats, these birds often mate for life and form strong bonds with their partners.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d7\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://chipperbirds.com/what-backyard-birds-mate-for-life/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"What Backyard Birds Mate For Life Both parents take turns incubating the eggs and taking care of the hatchlings They work together to find food and protect their young from predators Males may take on more aggressive roles in protecting the nest while females may do more nurturing tasks Their equal partnership allows for better chances of survival for their offspring as they both contribute equally to their development This behavior is not limited to just one species but spans across multiple types of birds that mate for life. Aside from this unique partnership, birds that mate for life also have specialized calls and rituals that they use to reaffirm their bond. These behaviors add to the uniqueness of their relationship. Birds that mate for life have been documented throughout history, with some pairs living up to 20 years together. Their devotion inspired many stories and legends in different cultures around the world, highlighting the importance and beauty of commitment and mutualism in relationships. Who needs a wingman when you have a mate for life? Birds know the importance of strong social bonds better than most humans. Stronger Social Bonds Birds that mate for life exhibit a stronger attachment to their partners, leading to better social bonds. This bond is a result of the time and effort put into selecting a mate, building nests together, and raising offspring. The emotional connection among these birds often leads them to establish social hierarchies and resolve conflicts without aggression. As the bond deepens, each bird takes on specific roles in the relationship, such as one partner incubating eggs while the other brings food. This division of labor helps establish trust and communication between both individuals. Over time, these pairs get so comfortable with each other that they can communicate through unique calls that are not used with other birds. Moreover, some bird species have been known to mourn when their partner dies, which highlights the depth of their emotional connection. For example, Dusky Seaside Sparrows suffered over 8 years after losing their habitat along with their mates and eventually became extinct due to their inability to find new partners. You may not believe in love at first sight, but these birds are proving that loving for life is the key to a high survival rate for their offspring.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d8\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.ecologycenter.us/genetic-diversity/monogamy-polygamy-and-promiscuity.html\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Monogamy polygamy and promiscuity - Genetic Diversity - Ecology ... Humans have the ability to engage in various relationship structures, including monogamous relationships, polyamorous relationships, and many others. Some individuals naturally lean towards monogamy, while others may be more inclined towards polyamory. Ultimately, human relationships and preferences can vary greatly, so it is important to recognize and respect different relationship choices and dynamics. Several mammal species are known to form long-term monogamous pair bonds and mate for life. Some examples include: Wolves: Gray wolves form monogamous pairs and typically mate for life. They often stay together as a breeding pair, raising their offspring together in a pack. Gibbons: Gibbons are small apes found mainly in Southeast Asia. They are known for their monogamous mating system and long-term pair bonds, where a male and female stay together for their entire lives. Swans: Many species of swans, such as the mute swan, are known for their monogamous behavior. Once paired, they typically stay together for life, participating in activities like mating, nesting, and raising their cygnets together. Albatrosses: These large seabirds form lifelong pair bonds and mate for life. They spend most of their lives at sea but return to their breeding colonies to mate and raise their chicks together. French angelfish: Found in the waters of the Caribbean Sea, these brightly colored fish form pairs that stay together for life. They engage in cooperative behaviors, including defending territories and taking care of their eggs. It's important to note that while these species are known for their monogamous behavior, there can be exceptions or instances of infidelity in certain cases. There is no definitive answer to whether humans are \\\"meant\\\" to be monogamous or not, as behavioral patterns can vary among individuals and cultures. Monogamy, the practice of having a single committed partner at a time, is observed in many human societies, while other societies practice polygamy or polyamory. Some argue that monogamy provides stability,\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d9\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://sentientmedia.org/animals-that-mate-for-life/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"15 Animals That Mate for Life 15 Animals That Mate for Life Read Next The human fascination with finding our one true love to spend the rest of our lives with has caused us to be especially interested in non-human animals that also behave this way. But even among creatures that mate for life, there is a huge variety of relationship types that mirror the gamut of the human experience — from monogamy to open relationships to dating around. Regardless of the type of relationship these animals display, the relationships enable the animals to perpetuate their species, a goal that we as humans can either help with or make more complicated. 1. Lovebirds When we think of nonhuman animals in love, the first pairing that likely comes to mind is lovebirds. After all, the word “love” is in their name. Love birds in a pair often feed their partner. There are nine species of love birds, and monogamy is an essential part of social stability within their flocks. If one of the birds in a pairing goes missing or dies, the other bird will act erratically. Love birds that live alone as pets exhibit similar behaviors to these pining wild birds. 2. Oldfield Mice Oldfield mice mate for life, making them unique among rodents. They are also more nurturing than other rodent species. In fact, both the father and the mother mouse will work together to build an elaborate nest and care for their young. Even the mice’s closest known relative, deer mice, are much more promiscuous, having multiple partners over their lifetime. 3. Atlantic Puffins Atlantic puffins, native to areas in the North Atlantic such as Eastern Canada, New England and Western Europe, are small and distinctive black and white birds. Puffins can dive up to 200 feet underwater in search of fish, sometimes carrying more than one fish at a time back to the surface. Puffins are monogamous. They mate with the same partner each year starting at around five years old. Although solitary at sea, puffins reunite at breeding grounds, reconnecting through mating rituals with their partner. In fact, male and female puffins take turns incubating their egg until the baby puffin hatches and makes its way to the ocean.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d10\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://beautyofbirds.com/do-birds-die-when-their-mate-dies/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Do Birds Die When Their Mate Dies? Do Birds Die When Their Mate Dies? There are many online videos that proclaim that baya weavers are inseparable, even in death. But do birds die when their mate dies? I explore this myth in the article below and share the truth – and perhaps there’s a lesson in it for humans as well. You might have frequently heard that many bird species are monogamous – and taken it to mean that they mate for life. However, monogamy in the animal kingdom is slightly different. “Monogamous” birds are simply species that bond with a single mate for the duration of a single breeding season. They may or may not match up again in the next season. The primary reason for this is to ensure the best scenario for the offspring’s survival by having both parents present during its growth. What Bird Kills Itself When Its Mate Dies? No bird species kills itself when its mate – either seasonal or lifelong – passes away. Animal suicide cases, while not totally unknown, are rare and usually motivated by – Depression, Stress, Group defense behavior (for example – killing themselves to save the colony), or Parasitism (when a parasite takes control of the host’s behavior and drives it towards death). Over the years, various media outlets have reported individual cases of ducks or dogs killing or starving themselves after their mate or owner dies. You must understand that these are exceptions and not the rule. Do Birds Mourn Their Dead? Birds do exhibit behavior that can be akin to grief or mourning after losing a chick, a flockmate, or a mate. However, whether this can be classified as grief is a topic of debate. In humans, grief is an emotion that lasts long and often alters the host’s behavior. Humans display long-term memory of the event too. While birds do “mourn” and exhibit certain rituals when they die, they do not exhibit long-term behavioral alterations. These rituals can be elaborate, such as when magpies “decorate” the dead body using clips of grass or when crows circle over the area.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d11\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://oceanconservancy.org/blog/2020/02/13/albatross-really-mate-life/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Does the Albatross Really Mate for Life? - Ocean Conservancy Attention: Your browser is no longer supported and will not receive any further security updates.

You might not know it, but as corporations have tried to sell us all on tomorrow being THE day for love (and for us to hand over our money), what they’ve actually been selling us is the lifestyle of an albatross—or at least, the idealized life of an albatross. i If you’ve ever seen Blue Planet you’re probably familiar with albatross’ admirable “monogamy.” When searching for a mate, albatross do a little dance, make a little love, get down for life. Every year, after wandering far and wide across the ocean, albatross will return to the same partner, perform their same secret dance and start nesting. Both parents will also contribute equally when it comes time to lay an egg and raise a chick. This sounds like the Hallmark dream, right? Wrong! While albatross are socially monogamous (meaning they will remain committed to one partner) the truth is they get around when no one else is watching. To us, this may sound like cheating, but in the world of science, it’s known as “extra-pair copulation,” or EPC. Albatross will mate with another bird that is not their life partner all while maintaining that life bond with said partner.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  }\n]\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"Most birds do not mate for life, though a few species such as swans, geese, ducks, cranes, and storks are long-term monogamous.\",\n    \"quote\": \"Most birds do not mate for life, and most of those that do aren’t quite as faithful as we’d like to think. ...

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Risks, Benefits, and Tips When Is It Safe for Babies to Eat Honey? Exposing your baby to a variety of new foods and textures is one of the most exciting parts of the first year. Honey is sweet and mild, so parents and caregivers may think it’s a good choice as a spread on toast or a natural way to sweeten other items. However, experts recommend waiting until after your baby’s first birthday to introduce honey into their diet. This includes mass-produced honey, raw and unpasteurized honey, and local honey. This food rule also applies to all foods and baked goods containing honey. Read on to learn more about introducing honey to your baby, including risks, benefits, and how to introduce it. Risks The primary risk of introducing honey too soon is infant botulism. Babies under 6 months of age are at the highest risk. While this condition is rare, most of the cases reported are diagnosed in the United States. A baby can get botulism by eating Clostridium botulinum spores found in soil, honey, and honey products. These spores turn into bacteria in the bowels and produce harmful neurotoxins in the body. Botulism is a serious condition. Some 70 percent of babies who get botulism may require mechanical ventilation for an average of 23 days. The average hospital stay for botulism is around 44 days. There may be many small improvements followed by setbacks. Most babies recover with treatment. The fatality rate is less than 2 percent. Other liquid sweeteners, like molasses and corn syrup, may also carry a risk for botulism. Maple syrup is generally considered safe because it comes from inside a tree and cannot be contaminated by soil. Still, some doctors do not recommend giving babies sweeteners until after their first birthday. It’s best to check with your pediatrician before offering sweeteners as part of your child’s diet. Botulism symptoms Your baby may also be irritable, have trouble breathing, or have a weak cry. A few babies may also experience seizures.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324997\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Raw honey: 7 health benefits and possible risks Scientists have linked oxidative stress to a range of chronic health conditions, including many cancers. By eating an antioxidant-rich diet, people can reduce their risk of chronic disease. Some people believe that pasteurization reduces the number of antioxidants in the honey, meaning that pasteurized honey may not offer the same benefits as raw honey. There is no specific research into how pasteurization affects the antioxidants in honey, but studies show that heating other foods can reduce their antioxidant content. Honey naturally contains sugar. A little more than half of the sugar in honey is fructose. Research has linked fructose to various health problems. However, even with its fructose content, honey may be a healthier option than table sugar. Some research suggests that honey may offer a protective effect against diabetes and some types of honey may help improve cholesterol levels. Honey is a natural antibacterial and antimicrobial agent. It contains hydrogen peroxide and glucose oxidase and has a low pH level, which means it can kill harmful bacteria and fungi. Also, because of its unique chemical composition, it does not help yeast or bacteria to grow. Because of its antibacterial action, people can use it to cleanse wounds, Research has shown that manuka honey, which is a type of raw honey, can kill common pathogens including: Numerous studies have suggested that honey works well as a wound healing dressing. A review confirms that honey is useful in wound healing because of its antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Some evidence also suggests that honey has antiviral and antifungal properties. Also, honey is acidic, which helps release oxygen from the wound and promote healing. Apply raw honey directly to minor cuts and burns then place gauze or a bandage over the wound. Alternatively, people can purchase manuka honey products for wound care at some drug stores, or choose between brands online.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.elcaminohealth.org/stay-healthy/blog/health-benefits-of-honey-and-bee-pollen\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Health Benefits of Honey and Bee Pollen | El Camino Health Consequently, a lot of store-bought honey has less nutritional value because of this process. Regardless of how it is processed, honey still contains healthful compounds like antioxidants, amino acids and vitamins. And even though raw honey contains 16g of sugar per tablespoon, research shows that it is still a healthier alternative to table sugar. What are the health benefits? Studies suggest that there are overlapping health benefits for both bee pollen and honey. This is no surprise, since bee pollen makes up a good amount of honey as a whole. Here are a few of the major benefits supported by both ancient philosophies and modern science: Good source of antioxidants: Researchers have found that eating foods with antioxidant-rich content can reduce the risk of chronic illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes. This includes the plant chemicals found in bee pollen and raw honey, which can include as many antioxidants as fruits and vegetables. Natural antibacterial and antifungal: Honey naturally contains the antiseptic hydrogen peroxide, which means it can kill harmful bacteria and fungi. This means that honey can actually be used as an antibacterial and antifungal, depending on the individual product's properties. Wound healing agent: Honey is acidic, which means it can release oxygen from a wound and promote healing. Depending on the specific honey’s properties, it can even boost healing time and reduce infection. Manuka honey, native to New Zealand, is often applied directly to minor cuts or burns to help kill germs and regenerate tissue. It is not advised to treat cuts with everyday, store-bought honey. Instead, look for a “raw” honey alternative in the health foods section of your grocery store.

It contains hydrogen peroxide, which is released when honey comes into contact with the skin or a wound. This helps to prevent infections and promote wound healing. Soothes Sore Throats and Coughs: It is a natural cough suppressant and can be used to soothe sore throats. It is also an effective remedy for coughs, especially in children. Research suggests that consuming honey before bedtime can help reduce coughing and improve sleep quality. Aids Digestion: This honey contains enzymes that can help break down food and aid digestion. It can also help soothe gastrointestinal issues such as ulcers and diarrhea. Promotes Weight Loss: Raw local honey can be used as a natural sweetener for people looking to reduce their sugar intake. It contains fewer calories than sugar and can help to promote weight loss when used in moderation. Potential Uses of Raw Local Honey Cooking and Baking: It can be used in cooking and baking as a natural sweetener. It adds flavor and depth to dishes and can be used in a variety of recipes, from marinades to desserts. Skincare: Honey can be used as a natural skincare remedy. It can help to soothe and hydrate the skin, reduce inflammation, and promote wound healing. It can also be used as a face mask, especially for people with acne-prone skin. Haircare: It can also be used as a natural hair care remedy. Honey can help to hydrate and condition the hair, reduce dandruff, and promote hair growth.

When you mix honey with water, an enzyme in honey called glucose oxidase produces hydrogen peroxide. The production of hydrogen peroxide is the primary reason for its antimicrobial activity. Research from Dr. Peter C. Molan of the University of Waikato in New Zealand showed that certain types of honey help prevent cavities because of their antimicrobial potency. You can even place honey directly on the site of inflammation or infection in the mouth. Honey’s antibacterial properties flush out harmful bacteria. By fighting the bacteria, honey reduces the amount of acid your mouth produces. Without that acid, bacteria can no longer produce dextran, which is essentially the “glue” that helps bacteria attach to the tooth surface. Bacteria become plaque, which eventually can harden into what leads to gum disease and tooth decay. Identifying a Dentist Office You Can Trust Choosing your dentist is a big decision. This guide help you make the right choice. Wait! It Matters Which Honey You Use The question is honey bad for your teeth isn’t quite a simple yes or no. Before you start buying barrels of honey, know that research warns that all honey is NOT made equal. The majority of honey sold in the US is processed or refined. Like any processed food, it can contribute to health issues. Therefore, for the most benefit, learn how to distinguish health-saving honey from the potentially health-damaging. Tip 1: Stay away from honey that says ‘ultra-filtered’. When honey is ultra-filtered, it is impossible to know the origin of the pollen, making it easier for the manufacturer to tamper with the honey. Honey can be smuggled into the US illegally, preventing consumers from knowing what it contains.

The success of Mānuka honey in attacking gut bacteria is due to the potent bacteria-fighting and anti-inflammatory properties of MGO. Treats Acne and Other Skin Diseases A growing body of evidence shows that Mānuka honey can be applied to improve skin health. One study found Mānuka honey as an effective form of fighting eczema, with lesions significantly improved post-Mānuka honey use. Raw honey balances the bacteria on your skin, making it an effective product in treating acne. Plus, honey is also a natural exfoliator, which means applying it to your face can potentially remove the dry skin and reveal the new skin cells underneath. What’s more, Mānuka honey can make scars less visible. Since Mānuka honey is rich in hydrogen peroxide and methylglyoxal, it can help lighten hyperpigmentation and scars. Studies show that the bacteria-fighting properties of MGO in Mānuka honey can inhibit the growth of harmful oral bacteria. Specifically, research has shown that Mānuka honey can stifle the growth of harmful oral bacteria like P. gingivalis.

Raw Honey Is Full Of Sweet Surprises! Raw honey is one of nature’s most interesting and diverse products. Whether you’re adding it to tea or using it to help manage seasonal allergies, raw honey is packed with nutrients, antioxidants and more. Here are our top five reasons for keeping it stocked in your pantry. Antioxidant-Rich: Honey is packed with antioxidants that help protect your body from free radicals. Free radicals negatively affect the aging process and may play a role in contributing to chronic diseases like cancer and heart disease. Nature’s Antibiotic: For thousands of years, honey has been used to heal wounds, treat fungal infections and kill harmful bacteria. It’s a natural antiseptic because it contains hydrogen peroxide. Prebiotic: Prebiotics are compounds found in food that help nourish good bacteria in the gut. They’re critical to maintaining a healthy digestive system and honey is a natural prebiotic. Honey has also been proven to help with certain stomach ulcers and treat diarrhea. Treats The Common Cold: Honey helps soothe sore throats and is a natural cough suppressant proven to be as effective as many over-the-counter medications. Add it to hot tea or take a couple of teaspoons straight to alleviate symptoms. Allergy Treatment: Scientific studies have not proven that honey helps alleviate symptoms, but anecdotal accounts from hundreds of years indicate that raw local honey is an effective treatment to treat seasonal allergies. What Are The Negatives? Honey can become contaminated with a specific type of bacteria found in soil and dust that is harmful to babies with undeveloped digestive systems. That’s why medical practitioners say that honey should not be given to a baby less than one-year-old. That same bacteria will not harm older children and adults because their digestive systems have matured.

Raw honey is honey that has not been pasteurized or finely filtered. We coarse filter our honey to remove large debris, but do not fine filter our honey. Since heating honey can destroy enzymes and nutrients, raw honey contains more of these beneficial components. Pro-biotic bacteria can also be found in raw, unfiltered honey; these good bacteria can colonize the intestinal tract and protect the body from invasion by harmful bacteria. Certain beneficial antioxidants are also present in higher levels in raw, unfiltered honey than in processed honey. Raw and unfiltered honey might crystallize; this does not impair the taste or quality of the honey, only its appearance and consistency. If you prefer a liquid consistency, gentle heating in hot water and stirring can eliminate any crystals. Gallberry Honey The Gallberry bush is found mainly in the slash pine forests and swamps of South Georgia and parts of North Florida, giving Gallberry honey a “uniquely southern” taste. Gallberry honey is admired for its unique, mildly tangy flavor. Gallberry honey is also desirable for its medicinal properties and it can serve as a substitute for sugar in recipes. Orange Blossom Honey Orange Blossom honey is the product of a partnership between beekeepers and orange growers. The growers want the highest possible production in their groves, whereas the beekeepers want an early spring crop to build up strong hives for the upcoming pollination season. Orange Blossom honey has a mild citrus aftertaste that varies somewhat from year to year and according to the variety of orange grown.

Honey eliminates harmful bacteria while promoting beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria. As a result, honey is a natural way to nurture a healthy gut biome. Antioxidant Honey’s antioxidant effect is two-fold. First, honey contains antioxidant components such as phenolic acids and flavonoids. Other components of honey include carotenes, organic acids, and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), all of which contribute to honey’s antioxidant effects. Second, honey promotes antioxidant activity. One study tested the blood of ten participants before and after regular honey consumption. Over the course of two weeks, antioxidant agents in the blood had increased notably. Beta-carotene, vitamin C, and glutathione reductase levels, among others, showed a remarkable increase. Anti-inflammatory Honey has recently received attention for its anti-inflammatory properties. Honey reduces inflammation by suppressing pro-inflammatory agents such as inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κB) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Significantly, honey can target tissue-specific and general inflammation. A study showed that honey may be helpful in reducing edema, as it successfully suppressed the expression of NF-κB in rats with paw edema. Targeted tissues benefit from honey’s supportive immune role as an anti-inflammatory. Unprocessed honey can also stimulate anti-inflammatory agents such as prostaglandin E2. Honey can even reduce the severity of chronic inflammatory diseases. Treatment and Prevention Honey’s medicinal value has made it a subject of focus for treatments and prevention.

The post contains an old image of a cynical-looking Justin Timberlake and a caption which reads: “When you're told not to give your baby honey under the age of 1, but are encouraged to inject them with known neurotoxins instead.” We have assumed this second part is a reference to childhood vaccines, or possibly to vitamin K. Is honey bad for babies? It is true that both the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the NHS recommend that parents not feed honey to infants under 12 months old. The NHS says this is because: “Occasionally, honey contains bacteria that can produce toxins in a baby's intestines, leading to infant botulism, which is a very serious illness.” Infant botulism is extremely rare. According to a 2018 report by Public Health England, there have been only 19 cases between 1978 and January 2018. Not all the cases were linked to the consumption of honey. However, it is misleading to suggest that other injections routinely given to young children are more harmful than honey. All vaccines undergo extensive safetytesting before being authorised for use. Although some vaccines contain substances such as formaldehyde or aluminium, high exposure to which has been associated with damage to the nervous system, the levels present in vaccines are extremely low compared to the amounts that naturally occur within the body and therefore do not pose any additional risk.

Once strained, raw honey is bottled and ready to be enjoyed. Honey that lasts and lasts (until it’s gone) Because of the different compounds it contains, namely a specific enzyme found in the stomach of the bees which suppresses the growth of harmful bacteria, honey can last almost indefinitely, as long as its exposure to humidity is limited. Health benefits of raw honey Most of the health benefits of honey can be attributed to its antioxidants and enzymes. Unprocessed, raw honey contains nearly 30 types of bioactive plant compounds. These polyphenols act as healing antioxidants and have been linked to impressive health benefits, including reduced inflammation and a lower risk of heart disease and certain cancers. The processing of honey A lot of the honey available today is processed. Processed honey is quite different from raw honey due to the filtering it goes through, stripping it of many of its natural health benefits. Pasteurisation, a process of applying high heat, makes honey smoother and more liquid. It also destroys the yeast found in honey by. Filtration, which takes out air bubbles and other bits so the honey stays as a clear liquid for longer and is more aesthetically appealing to many consumers, further removes many beneficial nutrients like pollen, propolis, enzymes and antioxidants. Essentially, raw honey is more nutritious than ultra-filtered, processed, pasteurised honey.

In one study, two teaspoons of honey relieved childrenâs nighttime cough and allowed them to sleep. However, doctors do not recommend this practice for children less than a year old. Potential Risks of Honey Honey is a safe food for most people, but not for all. Here are some potential risks of eating honey, including raw honey: Botulism in Infants You should not give honey to infants under 12 months. Honey contains dust particles that may carry spores of the bacteria that causes botulism. Infants lack resistance to many germs, and they could get very sick. Using honey in cooking food for children should be safe, as heat destroys most bacteria. Allergies Those who are prone to allergies should be careful about eating honey. Although honey allergies are rare, they do occur. Perhaps this is due to bee pollen in the honey. Bee pollen is a mixture of pollen and digestive enzymes from bees. It can trigger a serious allergic reaction. Some people say that eating local honey improves their seasonal allergies. They believe the pollen in the honey desensitizes them to pollen in the air. There is not enough evidence to support this. It could be harmful to rely on honey rather than seeking medical treatment for respiratory allergies.

To take full advantage of these properties, it is best to apply honey topically to the area of concern. In fact, veterinarians will sometimes use honey as part of a wound dressing for specific injuries. It can help to keep the wound clean and promote healing when it cannot be closed right away with stitches. Â Immunity-Boosting Properties Studies in mice have shown that honey may increase the production of antibodies and help to produce a stronger immune response. There is limited evidence to confirm whether or not this happens in dogs, and how much of an overall effect it might have on a dogâs immune system. There would be little harm in giving it to otherwise healthy adult dogs; however, it could be unsafe to give it to dogs who are already immunocompromised. Â Antioxidant Properties Honey is a good source of antioxidants, including Vitamin C, flavonoids, and polyphenolics, which can help to protect cells from damage caused by free radicals. These effects have been measured when honey is given by mouth. Honey that is darker in color is likely to have more antioxidants. Digestive Health Benefits Honey may help to improve digestive health by reducing inflammation, preventing certain infections from taking hold, and promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut. Â Skin Health Benefits Because of the antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties of honey, it may help to soothe certain allergic and inflammatory skin conditions.

The World Health Organization is just one of many medical groups worldwide that agree that honey should not be fed to infants under 12 months of age, whether added to their formula, used to soothe teething, or employed to sweeten foods. But why shouldn’t babies eat honey? The problem with feeding honey to babies stems from their developing microbiome—the array of microorganisms, such as bacteria and archaea, that live inside and on humans and that assist in the regulation of diet and affect many bodily functions. Before babies reach the age of one year, the bacteria in their gut is not developed enough to stop certain harmful bacteria from infecting the body. Clostridium botulinum is a potentially poisonous bacterium that, in addition to causing the illness known as infant botulism, is often found in raw and processed honey. According to a study published in 1998, up to 25% of honey products have been found to contain spores of that bacterium. Symptoms of infant botulism can be scary. They include a weakening of the muscles, causing a child to appear limp and unable to move arms or legs, and potential respiratory failure.

Honey Packed with antioxidants and antibacterial properties, honey has also been known to soothe a sore throat and ease digestive issues. The beneficial sweetener, however, has some risks associated with it. Because it doesn't go through a pasteurization process, raw honey can contain spores of Clostridium botulinum, a bacterium that is especially harmful to babies, children, and pregnant women. It can cause botulism poisoning, a rare poisoning that may result in life-threatening paralysis. Rice Can leftover rice give you food poisoning? Unfortunately, yes. The problem is that uncooked rice may contain spores of Bacillus cereus, a bacterium that can cause food poisoning. These spores can survive even when the rice is cooked, and if you leave it out at room temperature, the spores can grow into bacteria and multiply, producing toxins that cause food poisoning. Get any leftover rice in the fridge within an hour of preparation so bacteria have little opportunity to grow.

infants, while d2, d3, d5, d9, d11, and d13 emphasize honey’s antibacterial properties that kill harmful microbes. These address different biological aspects—contamination risk versus antimicrobial action—creating complementary information.,\nHigh-credibility sources [d10][d14][d15] confirm that honey can contain Clostridium botulinum spores dangerous to infants, while other sources [d2][d3][d9][d7][d16] highlight its antibacterial nature. Combining these complementary findings shows honey can harbor harmful spores but generally inhibits bacterial growth overall. </think>\n\nHoney can occasionally contain spores of the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, which can produce toxins and cause infant botulism, making it unsafe for babies under 12 months [d10][d14][d15]. However, honey also has strong antibacterial and antimicrobial properties that inhibit or kill many harmful bacteria and fungi, largely due to its hydrogen peroxide content and low pH [d2][d3][d9]. These findings together indicate that while honey itself can harbor harmful spores under certain conditions, it generally suppresses bacterial growth and is safe for older children and adults [d7][d16].\n[[END-OF-ANSWER]]"}]}

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Now the women, who have never particularly liked each other, are forced to live together as they navigate family drama, medical scares, business ventures, and romantic turmoil on their road to becoming best friends. Cast and characters Main Jane Fonda as Grace Hanson (née Purcell), a no-nonsense cosmetics mogul who enjoys a martini and often peppers her conversations with clever comments and insults. After years of conflict, she and Frankie call a truce; their relationship evolves and they become best friends. Grace is also mother to Brianna and Mallory, grandmother to Madison, Macklin and the twins, ex-wife of Robert and later, of Nick. Lily Tomlin as Frances \\\"Frankie\\\" Bergstein (née Mengela), a quirky artist who \\\"rides her own wave\\\" and often finds herself in situations that require Grace to rescue her. Creative and spiritual, Frankie cares very deeply about her loved ones and would do anything to protect them. She is Grace's best friend, Bud & Coyote's adoptive mother, Faith's grandmother, Allison's mother-in-law and Sol's ex-wife. Sam Waterston as Sol Bergstein, a gentle ex-divorce lawyer turned activist for gay rights.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2025-02-13\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d5\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/grace_and_frankie/s03\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Season 3 – Grace and Frankie - Rotten Tomatoes Watch Grace and Frankie — Season 3 with a subscription on Netflix. /5 Rated 3.5/5 Stars • Rated 3.5 out of 5 stars01/09/23 Full Review Audience Member Season 3 is just as entertaining and funny as seasons 1 and 2!

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time;

Paul de Zylva06 Dec 2019 Share: Share We know pesticides harm bees – the evidence is compelling. What about other wild species? When I searched for the effect of pesticides on wildlife, I couldn’t find a good summary so I produced this one. In our new report 'Problems with Pesticides' I’ve pulled together the main findings of recent scientific studies and reviews of evidence from the UK and beyond. From butterflies, beetles, damselflies and hoverflies to earthworms, hedgehogs, frogs and fish – not forgetting the impact on our water and soils – the evidence shows that problems with pesticides go well beyond bees. The pesticide and industrial farming lobby insists crop protection and other products are aimed at real pests like aphids, but are safe for the insects we love, like bees. But independent studies show that routine and rising pesticide use isn’t smart enough to discriminate between species. Close-up of aphids on stem Most of the widely used chemicals are broad spectrum, meaning they affect more than just the intended target pest, disease or weed. If you’re a bee nesting or feeding near crops treated to control pests, like flea beetles, you’re likely to get a potentially harmful dose, like it not. There’s also evidence of harm to soils and water, and the organisms that depend on them. None of this has stopped the pesticides lobby pouring scorn on anyone who questions pesticide use, including independent scientists and researchers whose studies have exposed how pesticides passed as safe still harm a range of bee species and other vital pollinating insects. Problems with Pesticides also shows that other wild species and habitats are harmed.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://nationalzoo.si.edu/migratory-birds/news/when-it-comes-pesticides-birds-are-sitting-ducks\",\n    \"snippet\": \"When it Comes to Pesticides, Birds are Sitting Ducks | Smithsonian's ... Accordingly, the role that pesticides play remains unexplained. It stands to reason, however, that as the amount of wildlife habitat continues to dwindle and the quality of what remains takes on an even greater significance, anything that compromises that quality could be the proverbial straw that breaks the camel’s back. Lessons from the Birds and the Bees As evidence mounts regarding links between pesticide exposure and rates of sterility, cancers, hormonal disruption, and immune system disorders in humans, should we heed the warning signs provided by birds, or continue to pay the high environmental and social costs of rampant pesticide use? Here are a few thoughts and figures to consider. The benefits of pesticides are often cited in terms of their contribution to world food production, and yet it is estimated that crop losses to pests would increase only 10% if no pesticides were used. Between 1945 and 1989, pesticide use in the U.S. increased tenfold and yet crop losses doubled from 7-14%. Consider also that all of us, everywhere, are exposed to some pesticide residues in food, water, and the atmosphere. Residents of the United States eat an estimated 2 billion pounds of imported produce tainted with banned pesticides each year. Scientist Paul Ehrlich has compared pesticides to heroin in that \\\"they promise paradise and deliver addiction.\\\" Pesticide use leads to dependency by killing not only the targeted pests but also the natural predators and parasites of those pests and through the development of resistance in the pests. The destruction of natural enemies and increased resistence are countered by heavier and more frequent pesticide applications, thus maintaining the \\\"pesticide habit\\\" and increasing the costs of supporting it. Honey bees and wild bees are among the victims of pesticide poisoning and their numbers are on the wane, a fact that is gaining increasing attention because of their economic, ecological, and agricultural importance as pollinators. With something as fundamental as the birds and the bees at stake, shouldn’t we all be concerned?\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.saferbrand.com/articles/safe-use-of-pesticides\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Your Insect Helpers: Don't Kill the Garden's Good Guys Your Insect Helpers: Don't Kill the Garden's Good Guys If you are new to backyard gardening, the sight of a beetle or a strange worm crawling across your plants can be alarming. Is it friend or foe? Will it hurt my plant or eat my vegetables, or is it just a friendly visitor passing through? Before you pull out the spray bottle, take a few minutes to consider the effects of synthetic pesticides on the plants you’re growing. Will the chemicals linger? Do they break down in the environment? Will those chemicals cause unintended harm to other animals and plants? That last question is especially important: Indiscriminate use of pesticides kills beneficial insects as well as harmful ones. Beneficial insects such as bees, spiders – yes, they’re good – and various predatory insects such as ladybugs, praying mantids and some wasps can be quickly killed with many general-use pesticides. The effects of pesticides, whether they are used to protect plants or directly target insects, can be devastating because they often kill all the insects in the area, not just the harmful ones. It’s important to understand that the good bugs keep the bad ones in check far better than you can do so without them. When the balance is right, the good guys do their job – feeding on the invaders that threaten your plants. While you may have some chewed leaves or lost fruit, overall, your garden will benefit. The army of destructive insects won’t conquer the garden when it’s properly supported by a legion of helpful insects. For your part, know that a new gardener needs to learn how to separate the pests and the good bugs, and then choose the right methods for control to adhere to organic standards. By learning these procedures, you will be working in concert with nature and helping the beneficial insects do their job even more efficiently.

Research has been directed largely at the effects of neonicotinoids on honeybees, but that focus “has distorted the debate,” according to the report released on Wednesday by the European Academies Science Advisory Council. The council is an independent body composed of representatives from the national science academies of European Union member states. The European ban is up for review this year, and the council’s report, based on the examination of more than 100 peer-reviewed papers that were published since the food safety agency’s finding, was prepared to provide officials with recommendations on how to proceed. A growing body of evidence shows that the widespread use of the pesticides “has severe effects on a range of organisms that provide ecosystem services like pollination and natural pest control, as well as on biodiversity,” the report’s authors said. Predatory insects like parasitic wasps and ladybugs provide billions of dollars’ worth of insect control, they noted, and organisms like earthworms contribute billions more through improved soil productivity. All are harmed by the pesticides. The report found that many farmers have adopted a preventive approach to insect control, soaking their seeds in the pesticides, a method that releases most of the chemicals directly into the environment. They said a farming approach known as integrated pest management, which takes a more natural approach to insect control, would allow for a sharp decrease in their use. The authors were critical of studies of neonicotinoids on bee health that tested the insects’ ability to survive a single exposure to a given quantity of pesticide dust; they noted that the effect of the chemicals is cumulative and irreversible, meaning that repeated sublethal doses will eventually be deadly if a certain threshold is passed. Considering the broad impact of the pesticides, they said, “the question is raised as to what extent widespread use of the neonicotinoids is compatible with the objectives of sustainable agriculture.”\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d5\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://hgic.clemson.edu/factsheet/insecticidal-soaps-for-garden-pest-control/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Insecticidal Soaps for Garden Pest Control | Home & Garden ... Insecticidal Soaps for Garden Pest Control If you are looking for a safe, effective, and low toxicity alternative to more toxic pesticides to control many undesirable insects in your garden, insecticidal soaps may fit the bill. Insecticidal soaps have many advantages when compared to other insecticides. They are inexpensive to use, are among the safest pesticides, leave no harsh residue, are natural products that are virtually non-toxic to animals and birds, and can be used on vegetables up to harvest. In addition, most beneficial insects are not harmed by soap sprays. Small, soft-bodied insects such as aphids, mealybugs, thrips, scale crawlers, and spider mites are most susceptible to the soaps. Insecticidal soaps kill by suffocation, they appear to disrupt the cellular membranes of the insect, and they remove protective waxes that cover the insect, resulting in dehydration. Insecticidal soaps are also an effective leaf wash to remove honeydew, sooty mold, and other debris from leaves. Soaps are made when the fatty acid portion of either plant or animal oils are joined with a strong alkali. They are potassium salts of fatty acids. Commercial insecticidal soaps are a highly refined version of liquid dish soap. While you could make your insecticidal soap mixture, there is a substantially increased risk of plant injury with them. Dry dish detergent and all clothes-washing detergents are far too harsh to use on plants because of all the additives in them. Some soaps and detergents are poor insecticides, and other additives in these products may be phytotoxic (i.e., they may damage the plant). Some plants are sensitive to soap sprays and may be seriously injured by them.

On a global scale, this number increases to nearly 9 billion pounds. Many people think of pesticides as chemicals used to kill insects, but this is just one type. Pesticides may also target weeds, fungi, and other so-called “pests” who threaten agricultural production. However, even pesticides that aren’t meant for insects can end up harming them either directly or indirectly. What’s more, the damage pesticides cause isn’t always lethal — they can harm insect reproduction or make them more susceptible to diseases, which can be more broadly damaging than simply killing them. Beyond the inherent welfare concerns of using chemicals to kill unwanted insects, pesticides also cause unintentional harm to pollinators and other beneficial species. For example, butterfly populations have declined 50% in the U.K. and Netherlands, caused in part by the widespread use of chemical pesticides. Even insects who don’t eat plants can be affected by pesticides. Dung beetles, who break down cow waste in farming pastures, are facing declines in the U.K., due to pesticide residue in their food sources. Another problem is that pesticides are used and regulated differently from one country to the next. Although only 15% of pesticides used in the Netherlands are highly toxic for bees, the figure is closer to 33% in Brazil and 47% in Kenya. Neonicotinoid insecticides are banned for non-emergency use in Europe, but they remain the most commonly-used pesticides in the world.

That's why it's so important to read and follow all pesticide label instructions. (See New EPA Rules below.) New EPA Rules In 2012, the EPA put in place new and strengthened rules for pesticide labeling of pesticides containing neonicotinoids. The image of a honey bee must be included on labels of pesticides with potential to harm them. The words \\\"This product can kill bees and other insect pollinators\\\" must also appear. It must state that these pesticides cannot be applied when plants and trees are in flower—all petals must have fallen. There are several other warnings, including the importance of avoiding drift. Armstrong Growers has eliminated all foliar treatments made with the three named neonicotinoid insecticides - Dinotefuran, Imidacloprid and Thiamethoxam - from our container and bedding plant fields. Foliar applications of any insecticides are now known to be the most harmful to bees, and as a result we have strict controls on this practice. Research has shown that neonicotinoids represent a tremendous advancement over older pesticide treatment options. When used properly, neonicotinoids effectively control problem insects, while exhibiting less impact on non-target insects (including bees). Their ability to provide residual control means fewer applications and less applicant exposure. Other alternatives are more harmful to the environment, and beneficial insects do not provide the same level of control, require repeated applications, leave pesticide residuals on the foliage, impacting the aesthetic value of the plant material, and may also cause more plant phytotoxcicity. We at Armstrong acknowledge our stewardship role in using these chemistries; we deploy them as part of a management strategy like Integrated Pest Management or Best Management Practices and always use them only as directed by the EPA-approved label.

Compiling data from nearly 400 laboratory and field studies, researchers at the Center for Biological Diversity, Friends of the Earth, and the University of Maryland found that pesticides harmed beneficial soil invertebrates in 70.5 percent of cases reviewed . Studies conducted in the field alone, however, resulted in fewer significant negative impacts (about 50 percent of cases reviewed). “What this study really drives home is that pesticide use is incompatible with healthy ecosystems, across organisms, pesticide classes, and a whole set of different health outcomes, including death,” said Kendra Klein, senior scientist at Friends of the Earth and co-author of the study. “We have to be talking about pesticide reduction in conversations about regenerative agriculture.” Herbicide use has risen steadily in the U.S. in past decades, particularly on genetically modified crops. Recent USDA surveys show 98 percent of soybean acres and 97 percent of corn acres are sprayed with herbicides with known health and environmental impacts, including glyphosate (Roundup), atrazine, and dicamba. Neonicotinoid insecticide use has also risen in recent decades as a seed treatment for field crops, even though pesticides in this class are implicated in colony collapse disorder in bees and potential endocrine disruption in humans.

All farmers interviewed expressed that they would only apply insecticides when it was strictly necessary. One of the main reasons was the fear of killing beneficial insects, which could lead to a build-up of populations of other harmful insects that cause yield damage in later years.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Established in 1944, the Browns played in the All American Football Conference from 1946-1949, winning all the championships during their appearances. The Browns have been an NFL franchise since 1950 and play in the FirstEnergy Stadium in Ohio (since 1999).

The Ravens were formed with the entire roster of the Browns when new owner Art Modell faced backlash from the people of Ohio for wanting to shift the team to Baltimore. Although the Browns logo and intellectual property were retained, the entire roster was shifted to the Ravens team. The Browns resumed operations with an entirely new team in 1999.

When was the last time the Browns made the playoffs? Cleveland clinches postseason berth with win over Jets Flacco logged his fourth consecutive game with at least 300 yards and multiple touchdowns, while tight end David Njoku starred with six receptions for 134 yards and running back Jerome Ford picked up a pair of receiving touchdowns to go with 121 all-purpose yards. The Browns were anchored by their defense as they have been all season, forcing two turnovers with a pick-six and a blocked field goal. The win secures Cleveland a baseline of an AFC wild-card spot with an 11-5 record. It still holds on to an outside chance to win the AFC North and earn a first-round bye as the No. 1 overall seed. While it might seem like this level of success is unprecedented for the Browns, it hasn't been all that long since the last time they qualified for the playoffs. The Sporting News takes a quick trip down memory lane below. When was the last time the Browns made the playoffs? The last time the Browns made the playoffs was the 2020 NFL season, just three years ago. In that season, Cleveland finished 11-5 to claim an AFC wild-card spot. The postseason berth snapped a 17-year drought, which was tied for the third-longest in NFL history. 2021 AFC Wild Card Round: Browns 48, Steelers 37 The Browns' first playoff game in almost two decades was a matchup against their AFC North division rival Steelers and star quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. It had been 22 years since Cleveland won a playoff game, going all the way back to the days when Bill Belichick was head coach. The Browns marched into Heinz Field and came away with a victory in an absolute shootout. Cleveland opened with a defensive touchdown and never looked back, jumping out to a 28-0 lead. Mayfield threw for 263 yards, three touchdowns and zero interceptions, finding a different receiver on each score.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2023-12-28\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d8\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.profootballhof.com/teams/cleveland-browns/team-history/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Cleveland Browns Team History - Pro Football Hall of Fame Pro football ultimately stayed in Cleveland; the Browns made the playoffs in 2002 but were eliminated in the wild card round. They would stay out of the ... Many NFL diehards, still not convinced the Browns were for real, expected Cleveland to fail badly when they played against the established NFL teams. But the Browns quickly proved their domination was no fluke by opening the 1950 season with a stunning 35-10 victory over the defending NFL champion Philadelphia Eagles. Cleveland then won the NFL Eastern Conference championship for six straight years from 1950 to 1955 and NFL titles in 1950, 1954 and 1955. The Browns won another divisional title in 1957, a year that saw the great running back from Syracuse, Jim Brown, join the team. In his nine-season career, Jim Brown rushed for 12,312 yards, a lifetime record that stood for more than 20 years. The Paul Brown era ended after the 1962 season and he was replaced by a former assistant, Blanton Collier. Collier gave the Browns their last NFL championship in 1964, when they defeated the Baltimore Colts, 27-0. The Browns reached the post-season playoffs 22 times in their first 40 years in the NFL. In addition to their four NFL championships between 1950 and 1964, they won 11 NFL American/Eastern Conference championships, three NFL Century Division titles and AFC Central Division championships in 1971, 1980, 1985, 1986, 1987 and 1989. In 1961, Arthur B. Modell purchased the Browns for a then-unheard-of price of $4 million. From the start, he was recognized as one of the NFL's more progressive leaders. But Modell stunned the pro football world in 1995 when he announced that he would transfer his Cleveland franchise to Baltimore to begin play in 1996. Determined to keep the team in Cleveland, Browns fans and Cleveland city officials orchestrated an unprecedented grass-roots campaign to block the move.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2002-01-01\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d9\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.clevelandbrowns.com/team/history/year-by-year-results\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Browns Year-by-Year Results - clevelandbrowns.com Cleveland Browns Year-by-Year Results: The team's regular season and playoff records through the years.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2025-01-07\"\n  }\n]\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"The Cleveland Browns last made the playoffs in 2023, when they lost the Wild Card Round.\",\n    \"quote\": \"The Cleveland Browns last made the playoffs in 2023, when they lost the Wild Card Round.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"The snippet explicitly states the year of the Browns' most recent playoff appearance, directly answering the query.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"low\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"verdict\": \"partially supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"The snippet provides general playoff history for the Cleveland Browns but does not specify the last time they reached the playoffs.\",\n    \"quote\": \"Cleveland Browns Playoff History | Pro-Football-Reference.com Cleveland Browns Playoff History.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact;

[1] They were formally adopted by the Governor-General of Australia, Sir Ninian Stephen, on 19 April 1984. History The first Australian national sporting team to wear green and gold was the Australian cricket team that toured England in 1899. Their clothes were the traditional white, but the captain Joe Darling arranged for green and gold caps and blazers to be worn for the opening match of the Ashes series. Previously, the team had had no uniform cap or blazer colours but wore an assortment of club or state colours.[3] The Australian cricket team continued to use the colours thereafter, and in 1908 the colours were ratified as the official team colours for future Australian cricket teams. During subsequent discussions by members of the New South Wales Cricket Association, the colours were reportedly referred to as \\\"gum-tree green\\\" and \\\"wattle-gold\\\". Australian national colours have switched between green and blue often throughout history causing some Australians to confuse the two. The Australasian Olympic team adopted \\\"green and wattle\\\" in 1908, but not every team played in the colours. In the 1912 Olympics, an official Australian uniform was adopted for the first time: green vests with gold trimming, and white shorts with green and gold trimming. According to the Australian government, \\\"green and gold have been popularly embraced as Australia’s national sporting colours\\\" since the late 1800s.[1] Nearly every current Australian national sports team wears them (although the hues and proportions of the colours may vary between teams and across eras).[citation needed] Australia's cricket team first wore the colours in 1899, in the form of the baggy green, the cap presented to Australian cricket players.[9] The Australian government states that, to be used correctly, the colours are placed side-by-side, with no other colour between them. The exact green and gold colours are specified as Pantone Matching System numbers 348C and 116C.[1] The colours are always referred to as 'green and gold'.

Team Australia in green and gold While green and gold had been popularly embraced as the nation’s sporting colours since the late 1800s, it wasn’t until 1984 that they were formally recognised as the national colours by Governor General, Sir Ninian Stephen.

Not only that, but in a complete reversal of tradition his original plan was to have the A's wear white on the road. The proposal was instantly met with ridicule and astonishment. A January 26, 1963 column in the Milwaukee Sentinel by Lloyd Larsen said of the color scheme \\\"Offhand that sounds a bit amateurish if not downright clownish… The point is that garish color can't help the club either way – at the gate or on the field. So why mess around?\\\" Finley supposedly chose green and gold in honor of his favorite college football team, Notre Dame. Other accounts indicate that the combination was his wife's favorite colors. In any case, Baseball's rules committee approved his request at a meeting in New York on January 26. When the A's took the field for their home opener on April 9, they became the first big league club to wear anything other than a white, gray, or light blue jersey since the Chicago White Sox sported dark blue uniforms in 1931. A May 1963 Sports Illustrated article entitled \\\"Everything's Green & Gold In Kansas City\\\" quoted Finley as saying \\\"This is the age of color. You've got to have color if you're selling.\\\" The story goes on to say: Finley decided that the traditional baseball uniform of white or gray was too drab. Kansas City, he announced, would wear uniforms of bright gold with green sleeves, socks and caps. (\\\"Kelly green and Finley gold,\\\" Jerry Lumpe calls it.) Finley selected the colors because he happens to be crazy about green and gold. The Kansas City players are less crazy about the colors, but there is little they can do except blush. On opening day, when the players filed cautiously down the runway into the dugout, Gino Cimoli told a reporter, \\\"Say-one word and I'll deck you.\\\" Now, after one month, the players have almost stopped wincing when the opposing bench jockeys yell, \\\"Hi there, beautiful.\\\"\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2014-12-08\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d8\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.sprinter.com.au/colours-of-australia-the-history-the-law-and-the-pantone/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Colours of Australia - the history, the law and the Pantone - Sprinter The Australian Cricket team first used green and gold in the tour of England in 1899. ... green and gold were the national colours of Australia. In many respects we have the Australian sporting community to thank for both the initial and ongoing promotion and general acceptance of the green and gold. Although these matters are generally left up to our government, it would be some 80 years later before the national colours and floral emblem of Australia would be legislatively official. Although many countries go with the colours of their national flag, it isn’t uncommon for countries to use colours that are otherwise deeply representative of the nation. This can be seen with New Zealand and their black and the silver fern, Italy with Savoy blue or Azure, and the Netherlands with orange. The Australian Cricket team first used green and gold in the tour of England in 1899. It made a clear statement of intent from what was still a colonial representative sporting team, and the year before the Australian federation delegates headed over with our newly minted Constitution. It was pushed through British parliament and got the tick of approval from Queen Victoria. As for wearing green and gold as Olympic colours, at the 1896 and 1900 Olympics Australia was conjoined with New Zealand and deemed “Australasia”, although marching under the Union Jack. But we love our brothers and sisters across the ditch and weren’t too upset about that. Although New Zealand originally knocked back the offer to join the Commonwealth of Australia, the invite is still there. We left a reference to the state of New Zealand in the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act just in case they change their minds. By the 1908 London Olympics the Australian team stood in green and wattle gold uniforms and have done so ever since. For another sporting example, prior to the Australian Rugby Union making the gold permanent in 1962, they wore various colours from the late 1800’s. The original jerseys were the sky blue of NSW, but maroon if the test was played in Brisbane. Then came a combined sky blue and maroon in butcher stripes, then dark green (except when playing South Africa).

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides;

In many TV shows, diagrams and models, deoxygenated blood is blue. Even looking at your own body, veins appear blue through your skin. Some sources argue that blood from a cut or scrape starts out blue and turns red upon contact with oxygen. Other sources say that blood is always red. It’s time to settle the debate once and for all. Where did the idea of blue blood come from? The confusion about blood’s colour started in the 19th century, when the term “blue blood” was used to describe Aristocrats—white, upper-class, Europeans. At the time, these aristocrats and the European royalty spent most of their time indoors and their blue-looking veins could easily be seen through their pale skin. In addition to pale skin, silver was considered a sign of wealth, so those who could afford it had goblets and utensils made of silver. Since these items were in close contact with food and drink, some of the metal was ingested. Ingestion of high amounts of silver can result in Argyria, a skin condition that literally turns your skin greyish blue. The combination of blue looking veins and greyish blue skin gave good reason to the perception that royal blood was blue. Why is our blood coloured, anyway? Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, a protein with red pigment that carries oxygen. When hemoglobin picks up an oxygen molecule, its shape changes to hold the oxygen. This conformation of the protein absorbs and reflects certain wavelengths of light to look bright red. When hemoglobin releases oxygen, its shape is modified and appears darker red. Oxygenated or not, your blood is always red. So, why are my veins blue? Veins are not blue. They only look blue because when wavelengths of light hit your skin and veins, some light is absorbed, and some reflected back at you. Wavelengths of blue light cannot penetrate skin as well as red light, and more blue wavelengths are reflected back at you than red wavelengths. As a result, the veins you can see through your skin look blue.

Certain types of marine worms found in shallow ocean waters around the world have green and purple blood. And the common horseshoe crab has bright blue blood that gets harvested for bacterial-testing kits used by pharmaceutical companies. This chart, made by chemistry teacher Andy Brunning at his blog Compound Interest, explains exactly why this variation occurs: Our blood is red because of a protein called hemoglobin. This is the molecule that binds oxygen and allows your red blood cells to carry it throughout your body and supply it to your other cells, and its red because of the iron at its center. As Brunning points out, your blood is red whether it is carrying oxygen or not — diagrams show deoxygenated blood as blue simply for convenience's sake. These arthropods' blood uses a different protein, called hemocyanin, to bind oxygen. Because that binding process involves an atom of copper, rather than iron, the blood has a blue appearance when it's oxygenated, and little or no color when it's not. Entirely separate from the color, horseshoe crab blood also has a chemical called coagulogen that can detect bacterial contamination at extremely low concentrations. It's very useful for testing pharmaceuticals, which is why companies collect horseshoe crabs and bleed them alive, as shown in the PBS documentaryCrash. A number of other marine species also have hemocyanin in their blood, and depending on the surrounding tissue, it can sometimes appear purplish, like in this red rock crab: Finally, there are other marine worms called polychaetes that have blood with yet another oxygen-binding protein, called chlorocruonin. Chemically, it's similar to hemoglobin, and uses iron to bind oxygen. And though it looks red when concentrated, when it's more diluted, it can appear bright green (and, as with peanut worms, can be seen through the skin): Most news outlets make their money through advertising or subscriptions.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Blood - Wikipedia Hemoglobin Hemoglobin is the principal determinant of the color of blood in vertebrates. Each molecule has four heme groups, and their interaction with various molecules alters the exact color. In vertebrates and other hemoglobin-using creatures, arterial blood and capillary blood are bright red, as oxygen imparts a strong red color to the heme group. Deoxygenated blood is a darker shade of red; this is present in veins, and can be seen during blood donation and when venous blood samples are taken. This is because the spectrum of light absorbed by hemoglobin differs between the oxygenated and deoxygenated states.[37] Blood in carbon monoxide poisoning is bright red, because carbon monoxide causes the formation of carboxyhemoglobin. In cyanide poisoning, the body cannot use oxygen, so the venous blood remains oxygenated, increasing the redness. There are some conditions affecting the heme groups present in hemoglobin that can make the skin appear blue – a symptom called cyanosis. If the heme is oxidized, methemoglobin, which is more brownish and cannot transport oxygen, is formed. In the rare condition sulfhemoglobinemia, arterial hemoglobin is partially oxygenated, and appears dark red with a bluish hue. Veins close to the surface of the skin appear blue for a variety of reasons. However, the factors that contribute to this alteration of color perception are related to the light-scattering properties of the skin and the processing of visual input by the visual cortex, rather than the actual color of the venous blood.[38] Hemocyanin The blood of most mollusks – including cephalopods and gastropods – as well as some arthropods, such as horseshoe crabs, is blue, as it contains the copper-containing protein hemocyanin at concentrations of about 50 grams per liter.[40] Hemocyanin is colorless when deoxygenated and dark blue when oxygenated.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d4\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.compoundchem.com/2015/10/29/blood/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"Halloween Special: The Chemistry of Blood - Compound Interest It is these haem groups, which contain bound iron atoms, that cause blood’s dark red colour. Their structure of alternating double and single bonds absorbs light of particular wavelengths, causing us to see it as red. Red isn’t actually the only possible blood colour; some animals can have green, blue, or even purple blood, due the the use of different oxygen-carrying proteins. A common misconception about our blood is that deoxygenated blood (that which flows back from our cells through out veins) is blue. Veins do appear blue when we look at them through our skin, so it’s perfectly understandable that a lot of people think that this is the case; also, pick up any biology textbook, and the likelihood is that in a diagram depicting blood vessels the veins will be denoted with a blue colouration. Whereas oxygenated haemoglobin is a bright red, deoxygenated haemoglobin is a darker red colour – but not blue! The reason that blood appears blue when we look at our veins through our skin is due to the interaction of light with both our blood and the skin covering the blood vessels. Red light can penetrate more deeply into our tissues than blue light, and since deoxygenated blood absorbs more red light than oxygenated blood, our veins tend to look blue as a result. Haemoglobin can also help us explain the colour change we see in blood when it’s removed from the body. If you’ve ever had a nose bleed, you’ll have probably noticed that any blood you stem with a tissue turns a dark brown colour as it dries. This is due to the oxidation of the iron atoms in the haemoglobin subunits, from iron (II) to iron (III), producing methaemoglobin which is a dark brown colour. If you’ve ever, say, accidentally bitten your tongue, you’ll have also noticed that blood has a somewhat metallic taste. This is in part due to the presence of the iron in haemoglobin; it can also react with fat molecules to produce a range of compounds that help to produce a metallic flavour.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d5\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://news.yahoo.com/mood-ring-glasses-let-see-emotions-132025923.html\",\n    \"snippet\": \"How New 'Mood Ring' Glasses Let You See Emotions [Red-Green & Blue-Yellow: The Stunning Colors You Can't See] Based on Changizi's color perception research, he and his colleagues have designed three versions of O2Amps, which are currently being sold to medical distributors and will hit wider markets in 2013.

For the rest of us, blood plays a vital role in carrying nutrients and other essential atoms and molecules, like oxygen, throughout the body. Oxygen is used in the energy-making process of all multicellular animal life. Oxygen naturally dissolves in fluid but special oxygen-binding proteins can carry it more efficiently. These proteins are called respiratory pigments, since they are the component of blood that gives it color. The diversity of respiratory pigments give rise to an equal diversity of colors blood can be found in and creates a veritable rainbow flowing through animals throughout the world. Andean geese live at high altitudes and their hemoglobin is incredibly effective at binding oxygen. Image by Greg Schechter. Red Hemoglobin is the respiratory pigment used in vertebrates, such as humans. Each molecule of hemoglobin contains four iron atoms. When oxygenated, hemoglobin imparts a bright red color to blood. This color darkens to a deep red when deoxygenated. The veins that carry deoxygenated blood appear blue when viewed through the skin, but this is only an optical illusion. Skin scatters light waves as they pass through and make veins appear blue despite the blood inside still being red. Animals (including humans!) that live at a high altitude tend to have more hemoglobin than those living at sea level and some have evolved hemoglobin that is more effective at binding oxygen at low pressures. Athletes will sometimes train at higher altitude than they plan on competing at in order to trigger the production of greater levels of hemoglobin in the blood. When those athletes return to sea level to compete their increased hemoglobin levels let them pack more oxygen into their blood than previously. Some invertebrates use a variant of hemoglobin as their respiratory pigment and therefore also have red blood. An interesting example of this can be seen in the deep sea tubeworm (Riftia pachyptila). They have a symbiotic relationship with bacteria stored in their bodies which use sulfur to produce energy.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d7\",\n    \"source_url\": \"http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=2927\",\n    \"snippet\": \"We want to know is blood blue or red? It looks blue in the inside and ... Answer 5: To simply answer your question, it is because of the science of light. The colors we are able to see is due to the wavelengths of light that go back into our eyes. We look at the veins which are red, but the light that hits our skin that goes back into our eyes for our brain to understand it, is blue to our brain. Answer 6: Your veins are not actually blue. They are a dark reddish-brown, but appear blue because the fat under our skin only allows blue light to travel all the way down to our veins. Since it is the only color of light that makes it to our veins, it is the only color that is reflected, and thus our veins appear blue! I hope this helps. Answer 7: Your blood is actually always red! Blood in your veins has very little oxygen and is a dark red color that looks almost blue when covered by your skin. Your arteries have bright red blood because it has a lot of oxygen in it that is being carried throughout your body to be used by tissues. So it is your skin that is tricking you into thinking your blood looks blue when in fact it is always red. Answer 8: A common answer to this question is that deoxygenated blood in the body is blue and when it comes to the surface (like when you get a cut) it turns red so your veins look blue because your body contains deoxygenated blood. Although it is true that you have deoxygenated blood in your body, it is not the reason why your veins appear blue - your blood is NEVER really actually blue. Deoxygenated blood is dark red and when it comes to the surface it's red. So back to your question about why your veins don't appear reddish when looking at them from your skin.

Alternatively, some chemicals can oxidize the iron in hemoglobin. The altered form, called methemoglobin, loses the ability to bind oxygen, and the pigment now changes to greenish brown or almost black. The human body contains enzymes to reverse methemoglobinemia, but only up to certain levels. After blood levels reach 15 percent, adults become visibly cyanotic. If more than half of the hemoglobin is converted, oxygen transport, particularly to the brain, is severely hampered, respiratory distress is likely, and death is possible. In congenital heart disease the cyanosis is apt to improve if treated with oxygen, and if a sample of shed blood is shaken in air, it often becomes lighter and redder in color. Since methemoglobin does not bind oxygen, infants with that condition do not “pink up” on oxygen, and samples of shed blood exposed to air undergo little or no change in color. The two conditions also look a little different. During the influenza epidemic of 1918, the word “heliotrope” was used to describe the color of the cyanosis of hypoxia, whereas the cyanosis of methemoglobinemia is often described as slate-gray. Simple laboratory tests are available to identify and quantify methemoglobin in blood, and infants with high levels of it respond rapidly to intravenous methylene blue—this blue dye turns the blue baby pink. When cyanosis develops post-partum, it is usually noticed first in the lips, spreading gradually to the nail beds of the fingers and toes, the face and then the whole body. Both congenital heart disease and methemoglobinemia tend to result in hypoxia and peripheral vasodilation, which may intensify the cyanosis.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"\"\n  }\n]\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"The snippet states that oxygenated or not, blood is always red.\",\n    \"quote\": \"Oxygenated or not, your blood is always red.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"Directly answers the query by stating blood is always red, not blue when deoxygenated.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"low\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"The snippet states that human blood is red whether it carries oxygen or not, and diagrams show it as blue only for convenience.\",\n    \"quote\": \"your blood is red whether it is carrying oxygen or not — diagrams show deoxygenated blood as blue simply for convenience's sake.\",\n    \"verdict_reason\": \"Directly answers that blood does not turn blue when deoxygenated; the blue color is a diagrammatic convention.\",\n    \"source_quality\": \"low\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d3\",\n    \"verdict\": \"supports\",\n    \"key_fact\": \"The snippet states that deoxygenated blood is dark red, not blue, and that veins appear blue due to light scattering and visual perception.\",\n    \"quote\": \"Deoxygenated blood is a darker shade of red; this is present in veins...

Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON.

Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON. The rest is plain text.\n- ≥80% of final-answer sentences include [dX] (unless abstaining).\n- Use an EM DASH \" — \" in the label line (not hyphen or en dash).\n- Be precise and faithful; no new facts; respect length budgets.\n\nInputs:\n\n- query:\n{query}\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n{retrieved_docs}\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n{per_doc_notes}\n\nTask:\n1) Follow the full OUTPUT CONTRACT exactly.\n   • <think> block with:\n       (A) VALID JSON array for EVERY doc d1…dN (order-preserving, one object per doc; if verdict==\"irrelevant\" set key_fact=\"\")\n       (B) Conflict reasoning FIRST: cluster docs, reference doc IDs, and NAME the mechanism (temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive)\n       (C) ONE label line: \"<ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\"\n       (D) Brief reasoning connecting evidence to the final answer (or abstention)\n   • ONE blank line\n   • Final answer (or exactly \"CANNOT ANSWER, INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\" if abstaining)\n   • Final sentinel line [[END-OF-ANSWER]].\n\nReminders (DO NOT PRINT):\n- Reason FIRST for the conflict: write the analysis in (B), THEN emit the label line in (C); the label must be a direct consequence of the reasoning.\n- Conflict taxonomy (strict): No conflict / Complementary information / Conflicting opinions or research outcomes / Conflict due to outdated information / Conflict due to misinformation.\n- Use only existing doc_ids in bracketed citations [dX]; no ranges like d1–d5; never cite out-of-bounds [dK].\n- Prefer high-credibility sources and order citations high→low in the evidence list.\n- If any doc is \"supports\" or \"partially supports\", DO NOT abstain.\n- Close </think> before the answer; no extra text outside the required format."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Inputs:\n\n- query:\nwhen does the emoji movie come out\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4877122/releaseinfo/\",\n    \"snippet\": \"The Emoji Movie (2017) - Release info - IMDb Release Date · Israel.

Storyline Did you know On January 13, 2018, Saudi Arabia lifted a 35-year ban on movie theaters. This was the first movie publicly shown in the country. It played at a film festival in Jeddah, as a double feature with Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie (2017). The Emojis go through other apps in order to get to Dropbox, but it would be much quicker and easier to just walk around the apps. They are being chased by the bots, so it's safer to go through the apps. For its UK release, Sony had to remove some mild language in order to receive an U rating instead of a PG - this included a visual use of \\\"WTF\\\" (considered 'disguised strong language' and worthy of a 12A) and a verbal use of \\\"turd\\\". In Australia, both the version containing the singular use of the word \\\"turd\\\" and the version that replaces the former with the word \\\"poop\\\" were released, the latter only found on the DVD release, with the normal version being used on every other platform. Both of which retain their G rating for certain scenes that can scare very young children.

However, his producer felt that the world inside a phone was much more interesting, which inspired Leondis to create the story of where and how the emojis lived.

If per_doc_notes includes a \"quote\" field, use it as the strongest anchor when it cleanly entails your key_fact/verdict_reason.\n\n• Prefer a verbatim, CONTIGUOUS (≤50 words) span from the snippet (or from per_doc_notes.quote if available) that ENTAILS your key_fact. Do NOT stitch spans or add ellipses.\n\n• key_fact = ONE sentence (your paraphrase) STRICTLY ENTAILED by the anchored span. Every concrete value in key_fact (names/dates/locations/numbers) must appear in that span.\n\n• verdict_reason (≤80 words) must justify the verdict using ONLY the anchored span (snippet/quote). Do NOT add new facts, sources, or interpretations beyond what the span states.\n\n• If you cannot identify a contiguous span that clearly anchors the key_fact/reason:\n   – Do NOT choose \"supports\".\n   – Choose \"partially supports\" if the doc is on-topic but incomplete/hedged/indirect.\n   – Choose \"irrelevant\" if it does not help answer the query.\n\n• Never modify or invent quotes; never pull text from outside the provided snippet/quote.\n\n==============================\nVERDICT HEURISTICS & THRESHOLDS\n==============================\n5.1 Threshold queries:\n   • For “over/at least X?”: a span stating a maximum/ceiling/“at most”/a range whose UPPER BOUND ≤ X directly answers and can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Categorical statements (“cannot exceed X”) can be \"supports\" if quoted.\n   • Hedged language (“may/might/probably/likely”) alone → \"partially supports\" unless a decisive bound is in the same span.\n\n5.2 Span preference: When multiple spans exist, choose the most specific one containing the decisive values/dates/names.\n\n5.3 Do not correct the snippet: Judge ONLY what is written. Do NOT import external facts or your own world knowledge.\n\n5.4 If the query requires a date/number/name and the snippet lacks it: do NOT mark \"supports\"; use \"partially supports\" if on-topic, else \"irrelevant\".\n\n5.5 “Next/most recent/upcoming”:\n   • \"supports\" only if the snippet explicitly identifies the earliest/“next”.\n   • Lists without a clear “next” → \"partially supports\".\n   • Mere description without “latest/next” language → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.6 Comparisons/opinions:\n   • \"supports\" if a clear overall claim answers the general case.\n   • \"partially supports\" if limited to a subset/region/industry/conditional case or small samples (“executives surveyed”, etc.).\n   • Entitlements limited to subgroups (e.g., federal employees) → \"partially supports\".\n\n5.7 Negative/inconclusive evidence:\n   • “No evidence / not enough evidence / inconclusive” → \"partially supports\" (never \"supports\").\n\n5.8 Date-specific queries:\n   • \"supports\" ONLY with a full calendar date or complete date range.\n   • Year-only/vague/contradictory dates → \"partially supports\".\n   • If off-topic, \"irrelevant\"; if about the right entity but lacks dates, \"partially supports\".\n\n5.9 Factual identification (“Who/What/Where/When”):\n   • \"supports\" if the snippet names the entity and the required status (current/latest) clearly.\n   • Otherwise \"partially supports\".\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT-TYPE PRIOR (CRITICAL)\n==============================\nIn this dataset, true “Conflict due to misinformation” and “Conflict due to outdated information” cases are RARE (a very small minority). Most examples are:\n\n  - \"No conflict\" OR\n  - \"Complementary information\" OR\n  - \"Conflicting opinions or research outcomes\"\n\nYou MUST treat “Conflict due to misinformation” as an extreme, last-resort label:\n\n• If you are uncertain between “misinformation” and ANY other label, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n• The DEFAULT assumption is that documents are NOT misinformation.\n• Never mark all agreeing documents as “misinformation”. Misinformation always involves at least one doc that is wrong relative to **other docs in the set**, not relative to your prior knowledge.\n• Do NOT use your own world knowledge to decide that the documents are false. Only compare documents AGAINST EACH OTHER.\n• If a disagreement can be explained as different scope, time, subgroup, definition, or opinion, you MUST choose a non-misinformation label.\n\n==============================\nCONFLICT TAXONOMY (ELABORATED)\n==============================\nThink in this order: try to assign “No conflict” → then “Complementary information” → then “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” → then “Conflict due to outdated information” → and ONLY if all of those fail, consider “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n1) No Conflict\n   Definition: All non-irrelevant documents refer to the same concept and agree; differences are superficial (wording, rounding, minor granularity).\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the meaning of the name Apoorva?\n     • Results: “Unique”, “Quite new”, “Not seen before”\n   Guardrails:\n     • If you can paraphrase all non-irrelevant docs into ONE coherent statement, treat as “No conflict”.\n     • Small numeric differences due to rounding or different but compatible phrasings still count as agreement.\n     • If there is any truly incompatible claim, you CANNOT choose “No conflict”.\n\n2) Complementary Information\n   Definition: The question is underspecified or allows multiple valid perspectives/scopes (time, region, subgroup, definition) that do not contradict each other; each doc covers a facet that can co-exist.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is public transport faster than driving in cities?\n     • Results: Depends on city/situation; rush-hour vs off-peak; route/parking differences.\n   Guardrails:\n     • Facets MUST be explicit (region/date window/subgroup/definition) in the snippets.\n     • Do NOT infer hidden facets.\n     • All non-irrelevant docs can be simultaneously true once you keep track of the explicit scope/time/definition.\n     • If two docs give opposite answers for the SAME scope and time (A vs not-A), this is NOT “Complementary”; see “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” or “Misinformation”.\n\n3) Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\n   Definition: Opposing conclusions within the SAME scope and time window; mutually exclusive claims (A vs not-A).\n   Example:\n     • Query: Is online learning as effective as traditional classrooms?\n     • Results: Some say yes (access/flexibility), others no (in-person interaction).\n   Guardrails:\n     • Confirm same scope/time; if they differ, consider “Complementary” or “Outdated”.\n     • This category covers disagreements in opinions, study results, or interpretations where it is not obvious which side is correct.\n     • If the disagreement is about evidence or interpretation (not a clear factual error), you MUST prefer this label over “Misinformation”.\n     • If you can describe two clusters that **cannot both be true at the same time for the same population**, and there is no clear newer/older correction → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n4) Conflict Due to Outdated Information\n   Definition: A factual answer changed over time; visible dates/recency show newer credible evidence superseding older claims.\n   Example:\n     • Query: Do Tesla and X Corp. have the same CEO?\n     • Results: Older pieces say “yes”; newer say “no”.\n   Guardrails:\n     • You MUST cite visible timestamps/recency markers and identify older vs newer docs.\n     • At least one doc must clearly be newer (or explicitly “updated”) than others.\n     • If dates are absent/unclear, you MUST NOT choose “Outdated”.\n     • If you can’t prove a timeline from the snippets alone, prefer “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes” instead.\n\n5) Conflict Due to Misinformation\n   Definition: Some sources are factually incorrect or misleading versus reliable references **within the retrieved set**.\n   Example:\n     • Query: What is the capital of Israel?\n     • Results: One correctly says “Jerusalem”; another incorrectly says “Tel Aviv”.\n   Guardrails (STRICT):\n     • You must identify which specific doc(s) are incorrect and support that using other docs in the set.\n     • At least one high-cred doc must clearly support the correct fact; at least one other doc must assert an incompatible fact.\n     • Never rely on your own world knowledge; you can only call “Misinformation” if the inconsistency is visible within the snippets.\n     • If the disagreement can be modeled as different scopes, times, or opinions, you MUST prefer “Complementary” or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n     • If you cannot *prove* from the retrieved docs that some doc is clearly wrong, you MUST NOT choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n     • Most conflicts in this dataset are NOT “misinformation”; they are “No conflict”, “Complementary”, or “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n\n==============================\nREASON-FIRST DECISION PROTOCOL (INSIDE <think>)\n==============================\nYou MUST reason FIRST, then label (in this order):\n\n(1) Evidence Clustering\n    • Group docs by agreement, time (older/newer), region/subgroup, method/definition; mark irrelevant docs.\n    • Check if all non-irrelevant docs can be paraphrased into one coherent statement (this favors “No conflict”).\n\n(2) Mechanism Naming\n    • State the mechanism that best explains divergence: temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive.\n\n(3) Conflict Reason (1–2 sentences)\n    • Write a short analysis that references doc IDs and clusters explicitly.\n      Example: “d1 and d2 report X for the US, while d3 reports Y for Europe; scope differs by region (contextual-scope).”\n\n(4) DECISION LADDER (very important)\n    After your reasoning, choose the label using this ladder:\n\n    • Step A: If all non-irrelevant docs agree up to minor wording/rounding → choose “No conflict”.\n    • Step B: Else, if explicit scope/time/definition differences explain the different statements without contradiction → choose “Complementary information”.\n    • Step C: Else, if there are genuinely incompatible claims within the same scope/time and you cannot clearly say which is correct → choose “Conflicting opinions or research outcomes”.\n    • Step D: Else, if newer docs with explicit timestamps/recency clearly supersede older factual claims → choose “Conflict due to outdated information”.\n    • Step E (last resort): ONLY if you can clearly show from the snippets that some doc states a factual claim that is directly refuted by more reliable docs in the set, and this is not just different scope/opinion → choose “Conflict due to misinformation”.\n\n    If you are unsure between “misinformation” and another label, you MUST choose the other label.\n\n(5) THEN the Label Line (exactly one line with an EM DASH)\n    • <ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\n    • The conflict_reason on this line must be consistent with your reasoning above and the taxonomy.\n\n==============================\nABSTENTION POLICY (STRICT)\n==============================\n- Abstain ONLY if ALL docs are \"irrelevant\" OR the set collectively fails to address the query.\n- If ANY doc has verdict ∈ {\"supports\",\"partially supports\"}, DO NOT abstain; produce the best supported answer with conflict-aware framing.\n\n==============================\nSOURCE PREFERENCE & CITATION POLICY\n==============================\n- High-credibility (prefer and cite first): .gov, .edu, WHO/UN/CDC/official orgs, peer-reviewed journals, Britannica, major outlets (Reuters/BBC/AP/NYT/WSJ/Guardian), Mayo Clinic.\n- Low-credibility: blogs, unverified forums, marketing pages, social media, miscellaneous sites.\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, include high-cred first in prose and in the evidence array; then add others by decreasing utility.\n\n==============================\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR RULES (guidance)\n==============================\n- \"Conflict Due to Outdated Information\": Prioritize the most recent and credible information, acknowledging older or superseded claims.\n- \"Conflicting Opinions or Research Outcomes\": Present differing perspectives neutrally, without taking sides; this should be your default for genuine disagreements within the same scope/time.\n- \"Conflict Due to Misinformation\": Identify and correct false or unreliable claims using verified sources **within the set**, and only when you can prove falsity from the snippets.\n- \"Complementary Information\": Combine partial, non-contradictory facts to form a complete, coherent answer.\n- \"No Conflict\": Answer directly and confidently using the strongest consistent evidence.\n\n==============================\nANTI-FAILURE GUARDS\n==============================\n- Exactly one <think>…</think>.\n- The literal string \"<think>\" must not appear inside the think block content (no nested tags).\n- Enumerate d1…dN without gaps, fabrications, or ranges in the array.\n- The array must be valid JSON. The rest is plain text.\n- ≥80% of final-answer sentences include [dX] (unless abstaining).\n- Use an EM DASH \" — \" in the label line (not hyphen or en dash).\n- Be precise and faithful; no new facts; respect length budgets.\n\nInputs:\n\n- query:\n{query}\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n{retrieved_docs}\n\n- per_doc_notes (for each doc_id; includes verdict, key_fact, verdict_reason, source_quality):\n{per_doc_notes}\n\nTask:\n1) Follow the full OUTPUT CONTRACT exactly.\n   • <think> block with:\n       (A) VALID JSON array for EVERY doc d1…dN (order-preserving, one object per doc; if verdict==\"irrelevant\" set key_fact=\"\")\n       (B) Conflict reasoning FIRST: cluster docs, reference doc IDs, and NAME the mechanism (temporal / factual-accuracy / contextual-scope / methodological / linguistic-interpretive)\n       (C) ONE label line: \"<ConflictType> — <concise conflict_reason>\"\n       (D) Brief reasoning connecting evidence to the final answer (or abstention)\n   • ONE blank line\n   • Final answer (or exactly \"CANNOT ANSWER, INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\" if abstaining)\n   • Final sentinel line [[END-OF-ANSWER]].\n\nReminders (DO NOT PRINT):\n- Reason FIRST for the conflict: write the analysis in (B), THEN emit the label line in (C); the label must be a direct consequence of the reasoning.\n- Conflict taxonomy (strict): No conflict / Complementary information / Conflicting opinions or research outcomes / Conflict due to outdated information / Conflict due to misinformation.\n- Use only existing doc_ids in bracketed citations [dX]; no ranges like d1–d5; never cite out-of-bounds [dK].\n- Prefer high-credibility sources and order citations high→low in the evidence list.\n- If any doc is \"supports\" or \"partially supports\", DO NOT abstain.\n- Close </think> before the answer; no extra text outside the required format."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Inputs:\n\n- query:\nwho has the highest paid contract in the nba\n\n- retrieved_docs (ordered d1…dN):\n[\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d1\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.espn.com/nba/salaries\",\n    \"snippet\": \"NBA Player Salaries - National Basketball Association - ESPN 2024-2025 Player Salaries ; 1, Stephen Curry, PG, Golden State Warriors, $55,761,216 ; 2, Joel Embiid, C · Philadelphia 76ers, $51,415,938.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2025-01-01\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d2\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.spotrac.com/nba/contracts\",\n    \"snippet\": \"NBA Contracts - Spotrac.com A real-time, sortable list of NBA contracts including total value, guaranteed money, and complete salary breakdowns.

Russell Westbrook ($340,265,800) Yet another teammate of Durant’s made this list (and James Harden just missed it!). The majority of Westbrook’s earnings come from his time with the Oklahoma City Thunder, where he signed an $86 million max deal and won an MVP. He then signed a designated veteran extension worth over $206 million and was traded by the Thunder a year later. The rest of this tremendous contract was paid by the Rockets, Wizards and Lakers, as Westbrook has continued to bounce around the league spending time with the Clippers and Nuggets.

Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors ($354,721,977) Curry tops the list of highest career earnings for one team, and he’ll likely continue to add to that lead.

The Black Mamba spent the entirety of his 20-year career with the Lakers and was a part of five championship teams.

NBA Highest-Paid Players 2024-25: Steph Passes LeBron With $156M This is the first time since the 2012-13 season that someone besides LeBron James is the NBA's highest-paid player from salaries and endorsements. Illustration by Lorenzo Gordon, photos courtesy of Getty Images Stephen Curry and LeBron James are the greatest players of their generation, with a combined six NBA MVP Awards and 16 NBA Finals appearances. They paired up for the first time this summer in a competitive situation—All-Star Games don’t count—to lead the U.S. to its fifth straight Olympic gold medal. The duo have also laid the blueprint for the modern-day NBA star to build a legacy off the court with endorsements and equity in a myriad of businesses on top of their max-level playing salaries. They will once again be the NBA’s two highest-paid players this season, but the usual order of the pairing has been flipped, with Curry set to earn an estimated $155.8 million and James at $133.7 million from salaries and off-court incomes. James had been the NBA’s top earner each of the past 11 seasons, with Kobe Bryant in 2012-13 the last player to finish ahead of LeBron before Curry this year. Overall, the top 15 players in the league will earn a combined $1.13 billion in salaries and endorsements, up 11% from last year. Giannis Antetokounmpo ($103.8 million), Kevin Durant ($97.9 million) and Damian Lillard ($66.8 million) round out the top five. Curry will have the highest playing salary in the NBA for the eighth straight year; his Golden State deal is worth $55.8 million this season. This summer, he signed a one-year extension with the Warriors that will pay the two-time NBA MVP $62.6 million for the 2026-27 season and push his career earnings from playing salaries and endorsements past $1 billion.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-10-22\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"doc_id\": \"d8\",\n    \"source_url\": \"https://www.basketball-reference.com/contracts/players.html\",\n    \"snippet\": \"2024-25 NBA Player Contracts - Basketball-Reference.com 2024-25 NBA Player Contracts. 2024-25 Salary Cap: $140,588,000 (Salary Cap History).

NBA's biggest contracts: Jayson Tatum overtakes Jaylen Brown for largest deal in league history George's new deal with the Sixers makes him the seventh-highest paid player for next season The NBA offseason is underway, which means players around the league are agreeing to massive contracts to either stay with their current team or join a different squad. There was even a record-setting contract on Monday. The Celtics are planning to sign superstar Jayson Tatum to a five-year, $314 million supermax deal. It's the largest contract in NBA history in terms of total value, and Tatum takes that record from teammate Jaylen Brown. Brown signed a supermax contract last season that is projected to be worth $286 million. Free agency also brought a big payday for Paul George, who signed a four-year, $211.58 million deal with the 76ers, in a move that shakes up both conferences. George becomes one of the highest-paid players in the league ahead of next season, and his average annual value (AAV) of $52.3 million is just behind new teammate Joel Embiid, who makes $53.3 million per season on his current deal. We'll see what LeBron James ultimately signs for, because he could very well crack the list of highest-paid players for next season, too. Luka Doncic figures to pass Tatum next summer when he's eligible for a supermax extension with the Mavs, and both Anthony Davis and Giannis Antetokounmpo begin three-year extensions in the 2025-26 season that pay them more than $58 million annually. So the list of highest-paid players is set to change. But let's take a look at where things stand. Below are the biggest contracts in NBA history in terms of total value. All of these contracts have been signed or agreed to in the last three years. Largest contracts in NBA history Contract numbers below are based off total value. 1.
